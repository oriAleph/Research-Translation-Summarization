<seg id="1">Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Model killed by a chef.</seg>
<seg id="2">Twelve years later, her family still has no peace!</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim is model Sally Anne Bowman.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 in the restaurant where she worked by chef Mark Dixie, who stabbed her.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both the victim and the killer had sex and smoked marijuana, then he killed her.</seg>
<seg id="6">The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched the painstaking investigation of the crime scene.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to a 34-year prison term in 2008 for the rape and murder of the model Sally.</seg>
<seg id="8">He only confessed to assaulting the young woman to the court, and his lawyer claimed that his client had found the dead girl lying on the street already dead.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police convicted him three years later.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting on the fateful night.</seg>
<seg id="11">The murderer said, "He was really upset, and after he attacked her the girl started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="12">"She even caught the attention of the taxi driver," he falsely stated.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to his testimony, the girl defended herself as best she could, but it was in vain.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lewis supposedly stabbed her on the street.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dixie's version was been proven to be a lie and inculpated him.</seg>
<seg id="16">After he confessed, Dixie spoke of his desire and lust for the girl.</seg>
<seg id="17">When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to smoke marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that he felt adrenalin.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added the Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="21">Twelve years later, the family faced further acts of aggression, with vandals destroying her grave.</seg>
<seg id="22">It has been damaged four times in the last half year.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are cruel people going around who dig up these graves.</seg>
<seg id="24">"So our daughter is not there anymore," Linda, the mother of the late girl, told The Mirror, describing the disappearance of the urn and ashes.</seg>
<seg id="25">Linda waited for the vandals, but they always attacked when she left the cemetery.</seg>

<seg id="1">Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands of crowns.</seg>
<seg id="2">"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="3">In it, you will find designer and luxury erotic aids,</seg>
<seg id="4">including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.</seg>
<seg id="5">It began inconspicuously about 12 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, one of them did not just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.</seg>
<seg id="8">"There were various kinds of moles and dolphins, and everything was green and yellow, and everything was totally different," he told me during lunch.</seg>
<seg id="9">His friend had decided to work as a partner to Fun Factory, the German manufacturer of designer sex toys, which attracted Martin, who offered to help with marketing.</seg>
<seg id="10">When his associate left to take up another position, he replaced him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today he runs the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benediktská ulice, where he sells sex toys in the way luxury handbags or shoes are often presented.</seg>
<seg id="12">And why not?</seg>
<seg id="13">They are also designer items.</seg>
<seg id="14">One second, are you asking yourselves, “is this what you talk about over lunch?”</seg>
<seg id="15">Come on, don’t be such puritans!</seg>
<seg id="16">It was the Fun Factory store in Berlin, which was designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as the inspiration for the Intimity boutique.</seg>
<seg id="17">It opened in 2010 and was based on a completely different concept of the erotic store to what everyone is used to here.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are no hidden displays, and everything is done in a beautiful, decent way, with the products exhibited like in a perfume store.</seg>
<seg id="19">Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to get hold of a shop in Prague, where it should be and what it should be called.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both of them liked the name Intimity.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's related to intimacy, and I would say it is gentle," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The next step was to purchase the internet domains and look for a suitable space that would work in parallel with the various visualisations of the interior.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the end, the variation that won saw the shop displayed as a garden of delights and a bedroom, dominated by beds.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio made it for us.</seg>
<seg id="25">We found the space in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="26">At first we thought it wasn't ideal, because it wasn't on the high street, but it was thanks to that that we came up with the name Intimity.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's intimate.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's in the street near to the high street, so no one can stare at the customers," commented Martin Ráž.</seg>
<seg id="29">We wanted to be the first.</seg>
<seg id="30">We wanted to create a shop that would be different, with good, branded products, in an environment where women, who are our main customers, feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be the kind of shop they aren't ashamed to enter.</seg>
<seg id="32">When I went to the Intimity boutique half an hour earlier, the streets were empty.</seg>
<seg id="33">I didn't even have the feeling that I was going to a shop with sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="34">As soon as I got to the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even though only women work in the shop, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, that doesn't mean that men can't step foot in it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Gentlemen mainly go to buy gifts for their girlfriends.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Men usually can not guess the right size, and they usually opt for one that is too big," chuckled Martin over the frequent mistake.</seg>
<seg id="38">This cliche refers back to a preconception that women need big sexual aids, but it isn't true.</seg>
<seg id="39">So although they have good intentions, men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator.</seg>
<seg id="40">Likewise, men mostly pick out black underwear, while women usually tend towards pink colours.</seg>
<seg id="41">The absolute bestseller at the moment is the appropriately named Satisfyer.</seg>
<seg id="42">The expression on my face must have made it clear that I didn't which kind it was, as Martin immediately explained how it works.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a kind of contactless clitoris stimulator.</seg>
<seg id="44">I feel the adolescent need to chuckle with admiration for the serious tone with which my comment is handled.</seg>
<seg id="45">As if it didn't phase him at all.</seg>
<seg id="46">At it really doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is affordable and has perfect reviews from its users.</seg>
<seg id="48">We couldn't believe it was so well received.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's like the most recent innovative revolution.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first revolution saw vibrators in the shape of a seahorse.</seg>
<seg id="51">It paid attention to the fact that women were starting to be interested in the design of these kinds of products.</seg>
<seg id="52">The second was the We-Vibe vibrator for couples.</seg>
<seg id="53">It completely shattered the taboo that had been persisting among some men who saw erotic aids as competition.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They make various kinds," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="55">With one motor, with two motors, and with remote control.</seg>
<seg id="56">That's the most popular category.</seg>
<seg id="57">While making love together, both men and women can have the control in their hand and alter the intensity of the vibrations.</seg>
<seg id="58">On the other hand, the category of penetrative vibrators was a complete washout,</seg>
<seg id="59">at least for us.</seg>
<seg id="60">Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they are only used externally.</seg>
<seg id="61">It is very popular in Western Europe, especially among younger customers.</seg>
<seg id="62">And what about men?</seg>
<seg id="63">It's hard to say, but it seems like this kind of concept would also work exclusively for men.</seg>
<seg id="64">It might have to be conceived in a slightly different way, however.</seg>
<seg id="65">The question is what to offer men," mulled Martin.</seg>
<seg id="66">"We have aids for them too, but only to a limited extent." Masturbators are the most sold, in our case those produced by Tenga.</seg>
<seg id="67">It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina but "more like a shower gel or an egg, or some kind of futuristic object.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is a lot of focus on functionality and user experience.</seg>
<seg id="69">It's completely different in Japan, however.</seg>
<seg id="70">It really surprised me.</seg>
<seg id="71">I thought the Japanese women were very picky about sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="72">"That's the Internet reality," he explained to me.</seg>
<seg id="73">Banal truth is quite different.</seg>
<seg id="74">Here in Europe, erotic aids are generally associated with being used by women.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Japan, they're absolutely normal for men, but they're taboo for women. Out of interest, of the products by the Japanese brand Tenga worldwide, which can be found in the Intimity boutique, about half is sold in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="76">In our waters</seg>
<seg id="77">Czech men and women aren't at all prudish.</seg>
<seg id="78">On the contrary, we are a very openminded country.</seg>
<seg id="79">There's definitely a difference from countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="80">A typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years and "has some experience with both sex life and using toys.</seg>
<seg id="81">They come for something nice and high quality, either for a fulfilling life with partner or just for themselves. To ensure that these customers keep coming back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka take care to check every product to make sure it's actually functional.</seg>
<seg id="82">We don't want to get involved in any specialism, such as bondage or latex, because we don't have a place for that, it doesn't exactly fit.</seg>
<seg id="83">These things might dissuade the people we're trying to attract.</seg>
<seg id="84">These are people were always too shy to go to a sex shop because they worried that they would find something like that staring them in the face.</seg>
<seg id="85">The variety of products displayed on the shelves is really appealing.</seg>
<seg id="86">It's also achieved through the selection of appropriate, renowned brands.</seg>
<seg id="87">Some of them have even won awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.</seg>
<seg id="88">The very first to win a prize was the aforementioned sea horse, "and that triggered change across the industry.</seg>
<seg id="89">Manufacturers stopped using cheap materials, and instead began working a healthy approach. They started producing different designs, in various colours...</seg>
<seg id="90">It's enjoyable to know that a Czech woman was behind the design, specifically the popular designer Anna Marešová.</seg>
<seg id="91">I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised how many people buy the designer Whoop.de.doo products by Anna Marešová from us, even though they are relatively expensive.</seg>
<seg id="92">There are customers who go directly to the Venus Balls by Anna Marešová.</seg>
<seg id="93">She did a really great job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be made differently and nicely, with a story.</seg>
<seg id="94">Anna's story started as a school project.</seg>
<seg id="95">Now it is a finished product that is produced in our country.</seg>
<seg id="96">I wanted to have control over the production process and I also wanted to know with what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.</seg>
<seg id="97">Because it is not large-scale but rather small series, which is certainly more expensive than a big series.</seg>
<seg id="98">Maybe I'm going against the current a bit, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">It may well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything." This is how Anna described the situation later, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more open.</seg>
<seg id="100">She isn't faced with a positive or negative attitude.</seg>
<seg id="101">At most, people are embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="102">"But then they will start to smile." At present, Anna Marešová range includes a vibrator that can come with a personal message, and she is also planning her own lubrication gel for next year.</seg>
<seg id="103">Next year, she plans to offer vibrating eggs and other new items.</seg>
<seg id="104">The border of healthy sex</seg>
<seg id="105">I'm interested in where the border lies of what's acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="106">Is there something that Martin Ráž wouldn't sell?</seg>
<seg id="107">That's very hard to define.</seg>
<seg id="108">What seems normal to one person may seem totally abnormal to someone else, so we define ourselves by our assortment of branded products.</seg>
<seg id="109">None of them are particularly extreme.</seg>
<seg id="110">Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they received?</seg>
<seg id="111">We just received an email, in which a woman requested a masturbation aid for her boyfriend, who was 28 cm long by nature.</seg>
<seg id="112">We had to reply that we don't have anything appropriate, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="113">But the question remains if someone was making fun of us," said Martin, casting me a suspicious look.</seg>
<seg id="114">It happens from time to time...</seg>

<seg id="1">The Chilean parliament ends the ban on abortions as the Constitutional Court passes a law.</seg>
<seg id="2">Until now, there has been a total ban on aborting pregnancies in Chile, even for medical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I am sorry that the lawmakers filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court, so that now there will be ten people deciding on what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should get a new president, who is close to the opposition according to the AFP.</seg>
<seg id="5">The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion was initiated by the current President Michelle Bachelet, and was approved by the Senate on 19 July.</seg>
<seg id="6">The right-wing opposition then announced that it would appeal the law would at court, on the grounds that it violated the unborn child's right to live.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members of parliament postponed the vote last month while the Joint Parliamentary Committee carried out an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="8">MPs approved the draft on Wednesday and the Senate convened after them.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the new legislation, pregnancies can be ended in three cases: if the woman's life will be endangered, if the foetus has no hope of survival or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the Spanish paper El País, similar exceptions existed in Chile since 1931, which was before women were given the right to vote in 1949.</seg>
<seg id="11">The total ban on abortions was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidential office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chile is one of the few countries in the world to enforce an absolute ban on abortion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.</seg>
<seg id="14">In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are currently behind bars, serving prison sentences of up to 30 years for the termination of their pregnancies.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to human rights defenders, many cases declared murder by the court are actually miscarriage.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="2">Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="3">The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."</seg>
<seg id="13">There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="20">The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="21">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">The torch is not to light the way to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="25">Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB</seg>
<seg id="2">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team</seg>
<seg id="3">UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="4">A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="9">British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the guy on the corner street, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="12">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Eilidh is slightly modest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="20">She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It just shows how far we've come.</seg>
<seg id="27">And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for my captain's speech?</seg>
<seg id="29">Yeah, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="30">I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="31">So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="38">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="43">Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="45">Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="46">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Czechs have quickly taken to free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.</seg>
<seg id="2">Czechs consume more of their tariffs abroad than at home.</seg>
<seg id="3">They travel in Austria most often, but in the summer season the consumption of data is dominated by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="4">While on holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and most of the time they are not able to connect to Wi-Fi under the breach umbrellas.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beach and bathing, smart phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is how a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks now that customers can use services by local operators as part of their home tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="7">O2 recently released statistics painting this picture.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad can access more data as part of their normal rate at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no wonder, then, that in Croatia, where a minimal amount of our countrymen go in winter, consumption of data rose by as much as fifty times this summer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Italy ranked second in the list of consumed data.</seg>
<seg id="11">Czechs use the most minutes calling from Germany, where they go to work a lot during the summer.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia each year, making it our most popular holiday destination.</seg>
<seg id="13">People have swapped their holiday books for sharing their experiences on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="14">The record was 7 July.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Tens of millions of photographs were transferred with the data," said Silvia Cieslarová, director of the O2 mobile department.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Croatia comes first in terms of the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users can be found in neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.</seg>
<seg id="19">We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, meaning we do not have much time to browse the internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Most Czechs head through Austria towards the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the operator recorded a year-on-year growth in roaming charges, the number of phone calls remains much lower.</seg>
<seg id="22">The number of minutes used while roaming double in relation to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Calls while roaming are more likely to be made by business customers on work trips," Cieslarová added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a great showcase for this course."</seg>
<seg id="9">Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's a wonderful place to play golf in.</seg>
<seg id="14">The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."</seg>
<seg id="16">Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm happy with how it's going so far."</seg>
<seg id="22">Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.</seg>
<seg id="23">Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."</seg>
<seg id="127">Local people want more foreign governments to take note.</seg>
<seg id="128">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="129">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.</seg>
<seg id="131">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="132">Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="133">"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="134">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.</seg>

<seg id="2">The French Navy seized a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine, worth about $256 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consignment was headed to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The four-man crew was arrested during the siege, and was apparently formed of Lithuanian and Latvian people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The yacht, which was named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police dragged it to a port in Nouméa, a metropolis in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were going to and from, and to unmask the "Lithuanian syndicate".</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are grateful to the French authorities for taking measures that have stopped a large number of drugs targeting Australia," said managing director Col Blanch.</seg>

<seg id="1">Seniors don't feel thirst and need to be reminded to drink.</seg>
<seg id="2">The problem can be found in seniors' homes, and according to Pavla Mádlová, a physician from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, the solution could be an infusion of a physiological solution under the skin with a thin needle.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, at present this approach is only applied in health care facilities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The older a person is, the more the amount of water in their body decreases.</seg>
<seg id="5">"And they also lose their sense of thirst, so seniors generally drink less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," said Mádlová.</seg>
<seg id="6">They should definitely drink two litres.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.</seg>
<seg id="8">She thinks that doctors often don't monitor this in care homes for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="9">In hospitals, dehydration is commonly treated with infusions.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I think subcutaneous infusions should be gradually introduced there too," she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">In her opinion, older people can be given a two-litre bottle of physiological saline in one day.</seg>
<seg id="12">A lack of fluids can cause malnutrition, headaches and decreased performance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, and starts talking in a confused way," she added.</seg>
<seg id="15">If ignored, it could lead to a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Blood becomes thicker and clogs the blood vessels in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, at most they should have cotton sheets.</seg>
<seg id="18">Disposable incontinence pants may also be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It's more demanding on the nursing staff, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin breathe," the doctor explained.</seg>

<seg id="2">A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="2">A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.</seg>
<seg id="3">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.</seg>
<seg id="13">For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.</seg>
<seg id="14">Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.</seg>

<seg id="1">EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.</seg>
<seg id="5">At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="7">Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="16">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="19">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="23">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."</seg>

<seg id="1">A man carries out an acid attack but the court declares him not dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="2">You never know what can happen to you.</seg>
<seg id="3">One moment, you're at home laughing with your family, and the next your whole life is shaken to the core.</seg>
<seg id="4">And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the fate that met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reuters reported on the story.</seg>
<seg id="7">In December 2014, someone at knocked on the Christopheros' door.</seg>
<seg id="8">Andreas got up to open it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He thought that the person at the door was probably the courier who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gifts for the family that day.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead, a terrible surprise awaited him.</seg>
<seg id="11">A man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him without warning as soon as he opened up, saying, "That's for you, friend."</seg>
<seg id="12">The pain was indescribable.</seg>
<seg id="13">My clothes dissolved into nothing, and I just felt an unreal pain on my skin," said Andreas.</seg>
<seg id="14">His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his relatives learned terrible news there - the doctors said he had no chance to survive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to the infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.</seg>
<seg id="16">His injuries were very serious.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ninety percent of his face was affected, and the doctors attempted to piece it back together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.</seg>
<seg id="18">One major complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.</seg>
<seg id="19">Without doubt, it's the most painful thing I've ever experienced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You can't escape from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his suffering.</seg>
<seg id="21">At this point, Christopheros has undergone twelve operations and is still far away from the last.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to plastic surgeons, injuries affecting sufferers of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgical interventions and years of healing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even after demanding, long-term treatment, the victims still have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Sometimes people do not recover, and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Peter Dziewulski, a spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.</seg>
<seg id="25">The attacker made a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="26">In terms of the attack, Christopheros is convinced that the unknown man must have confused him with someone else.</seg>
<seg id="27">The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused someone close to him.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police investigated the case thoroughly and finally tracked down the assailant.</seg>
<seg id="29">The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, the verdict was later fundamentally altered, much to the astonishment of Christopher's family.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be abolished because the man was not considered to be a threat to the public," said Christopheros.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number attacks using corrosive substances has increased considerably over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="33">The UK Ministry of the Interior has announced that it plans to tackle the issue by issuing new guidelines to prosecutors concerning the classification of corrosives.</seg>
<seg id="34">They should be classified as dangerous weapons.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, the victims of these attacks are unwilling to give up.</seg>
<seg id="36">They are demanding that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people attacking their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.</seg>
<seg id="37">They are also calling for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in many shops since they consist of various cleaning products.</seg>

<seg id="5">"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.</seg>

<seg id="9">"We ran down the stairs, which took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George described the scene.</seg>
<seg id="10">Other witnesses speaking to CNN estimated that the flames affected about 40 homes.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when parts of the burning building crashed down on them.</seg>

<seg id="13">The cause of the outbreak is not yet known.</seg>

<seg id="1">China is lacking tourists.</seg>
<seg id="2">Beijing is losing billions because of the national visa policies.</seg>
<seg id="3">For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="4">It spends 10 billion dollars a year to support language schools and establish universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry towards foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.</seg>
<seg id="5">It isn't doing anything for Beijing, however.</seg>
<seg id="6">The local state media has been talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the number of visitors grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent China's tourists came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among other things, this is due to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, the Chinese Foreign Minister does not welcome foreigners with open arms. At least this is how Christopher Balding, Professor of Economics at Beijing University, assessed the situation in the most populous country of the world in an article for Bloomberg.</seg>
<seg id="9">One particularly indicative example is the Chinese visa policy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only 13 countries have visa-free entry to China, while the citizens of the others have to organise visas in advance.</seg>
<seg id="11">As such, the Chinese offices in the US have crowds comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The visa costs 140 dollars, but if you do not want to wait in the queue for hours, you have to pay 100 dollars or more for additional services.</seg>
<seg id="13">These kinds of restrictions create significant economic barriers.</seg>
<seg id="14">A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduces the visitor numbers by 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans went to Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of its population.</seg>
<seg id="16">China often worsens this problem when it uses tourist activities to pursue its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="17">When China restricted transportation to South Korea during a rift concerning the South Korean missile defence system, the South Koreans retaliated by avoiding China.</seg>
<seg id="18">In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent from the previous year, whereas in Japan the same figure grew by 85 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">All this affects macroeconomic stability.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to a recently published report by the Fed (the American Federal Reserve), up to 190 billion dollars may have left China as a result of foreign trips by Chinese people, while China only gains around 35 billion dollars a year through sales of foreign currency to incoming tourists.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the official figures for the development of the balance of payments, last year China had a deficit of 217 billion dollars in terms of tourism, equivalent to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in commodities trading.</seg>
<seg id="22">This small number of tourists comes as a very painful blow to a country that has anxiously protected the flow of capital.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more a general restraint in relation to foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="24">In many parts of China, practically nobody has heard about immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="25">In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the United States, however, there are more of them living in certain cities.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even Japan, which is not known as the crossroads of immigration, has twice as many foreign inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">The number of deadly poisonous reptiles at Pilsen Zoo has increased.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the Království jedu (Poison Kingdom) in Pilsen, visitors can now look forward to seeing the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the meantime, visitors can see the nine newly born Turkish vipers at the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="4">This species lives in northern Anatolia, at altitudes of up to 2000 metres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They grow up to a metre long," said Martin Vobruba, a spokesperson for the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="6">The young of the other two species, the death adders and the red cobras, will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.</seg>
<seg id="7">We still cannot say when people will see them.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We wouldn't want to lose them," said the carer Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight Australian death adders have been born, and are the descendants of a breeding pair from the population around Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The specimen that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the death adders from around Perth," said Vobruba, adding that in capitivity it is necessary for death adders to hibernate for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">There was a hundred percent success rate for a group of African spitting red cobras.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pair in Pilsen Zoo hatched four babies out of four eggs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The incubation lasted for 65 days," Vobruba explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the wild, this species shoots poison at distances of up to four metres.</seg>
<seg id="15">If it gets into eyes, it can cause long-term blindness.</seg>
<seg id="16">The young of all three species are fed with mice in the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="17">The young of black mambas will be waiting to hatch in the garden for up to 40 days, as the eggs are stored in an incubator.</seg>

<seg id="2">Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="3">On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.</seg>
<seg id="4">The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."</seg>
<seg id="5">Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.</seg>
<seg id="6">Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."</seg>

<seg id="1">Tusk testifies at the prosecutor's office again regarding Smolensk.</seg>
<seg id="2">"He should be afraid," announced brother of the dead president and leader of the Law and Justice party Jaroslaw Kaczynski at Tusk's address.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me," responded Tusk, reproaching the country's current leaders for trying to pervert justice to attack his political rivals.</seg>
<seg id="4">As he left the headquarters of the Prosecutor's Office, according to television channel TVN 4 a crowd was waiting for Donald Tusk and chanting his name. They also wished the politician good health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tusk thanked them for their support and assured them his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me."</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the prosecutors he isn't accused of anything, but there is no doubt that justice system is being used to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against its adversaries, opposition or people who do not like it, and I am afraid I belong to this group.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was his second time at the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the second time the ex-prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office, and on this occasion he was questioned over mistakes during the autopsies of the Smolensk disaster victims.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, there was discussion on bodies being changed in the coffins.</seg>
<seg id="10">The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason behind it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason was that they were afraid of scandal that would put pressure on Polish-Russian relations.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Maintaining good relations at all costs, in spite of such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," said Kaczyński to the Catholic television channel Trwam.</seg>
<seg id="13">He added that a possible conflict with Russia could have affected Tusk's chances of reaching the most important seat in the Union, which Poland absolutely does not have.</seg>
<seg id="14">Kaczynski also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it might turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she didn't pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tusk endured an eight-hour examination at the Prosecutor's Office on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="16">He didn't testified as a suspect, however, only as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, many people considered his summons to be part of the apparent effort of the Polish government and Law and Justice leader Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him with various scandals.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Poland the prosecutor's office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.</seg>
<seg id="19">The call for questioning came shortly after Tuska was elected the President of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried to prevent in vain, including during Merkel's visit in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="20">Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło protested the prolongation of Tusk's mandate at the EU summit.</seg>
<seg id="21">In that instance Hungarian premiere Viktor Orban also left Warsaw stranded.</seg>

<seg id="2">Where in the world can Czechs vote?</seg>
<seg id="3">During the parliamentary elections this autumn, registered voters will once again be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Czech Republic has opened up its embassies in these and several other countries since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="5">This move is intended to fulfil a decree regulating the delivery of ballot papers abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has updated it, and is currently in the process of sending out reminders.</seg>
<seg id="7">Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that have to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explained.</seg>
<seg id="9">"New embassies have been established in some countries, while certain offices have been closed or the levels of representation have changed," according to the text.</seg>
<seg id="10">The decree contains two annexes, the first of which states the embassies that will be supplied with ballot papers.</seg>
<seg id="11">This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="12">More than one hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot sheet to be printed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The list of which ones is changing with the decree, however.</seg>
<seg id="14">Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both embassies are now closed.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Czech Republic also ended its representation in Bamako, Mali and Kyoto, Japan.</seg>
<seg id="17">People will also not be able to vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.</seg>
<seg id="18">That was closed by the Czech Republic in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="19">New additions to the list of embassies include Nairobi in Kenya, Dakar in Senegal and Lusaka in Zambia.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation in Asia through the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq and Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province.</seg>
<seg id="21">Voting cards will also be available for voters registered at the Czech Embassies in Burma and Cambodia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose their deputies at polling stations in embassies or consulates four times.</seg>
<seg id="23">Before each election, the state electoral committee determines which regions' candidates can be voted for abroad by ballot.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first time was in 2002, when it was decided among the South Moravian candidates.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the next two elections, the Czechs voting abroad could also select South Bohemian candidates.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was included as well.</seg>
<seg id="27">The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 3800 people voted the first time 15 years ago, then about 6700 in 2006 and 8222 four years later.</seg>
<seg id="29">The previous parliamentary elections four years ago saw 10,571 voters come to the embassies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice</seg>
<seg id="2">A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="8">Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one has ever been charged with the murders.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."</seg>
<seg id="19">A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">But not one was ever prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="31">Brooks put it more succinctly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"</seg>
<seg id="34">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."</seg>
<seg id="39">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.</seg>
<seg id="41">He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."</seg>
<seg id="44">Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="45">The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I said n---a, get off my property!"</seg>
<seg id="47">Rascona fires back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There's a beat.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="50">Greene laughs the hardest.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's alarmed, confused.</seg>
<seg id="53">Did I go too hard?</seg>
<seg id="54">"No," Greene said through chuckles.</seg>
<seg id="55">"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"</seg>
<seg id="56">"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.</seg>
<seg id="57">"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"</seg>
<seg id="58">And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="61">This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reenactment ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.</seg>
<seg id="65">A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="66">Her voice breaks on every other word.</seg>
<seg id="67">A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="68">The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="69">One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="70">They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="71">Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.</seg>
<seg id="72">As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="73">Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.</seg>
<seg id="74">"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.</seg>
<seg id="75">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="76">The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.</seg>
<seg id="79">"It's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="80">"We know that's not what's in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="81">You did this for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="82">Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.</seg>
<seg id="83">At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.</seg>
<seg id="84">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="85">"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="86">"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."</seg>
<seg id="87">Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.</seg>
<seg id="89">"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="90">"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="91">Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."</seg>

<seg id="1">I love user instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2">One of my friends says that only quitters read user instructions.</seg>
<seg id="3">I completely disagree.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a form of modern art, and often pure surrealism.</seg>
<seg id="5">I look back with nostalgia on the distant past, when user instructions for anything were a rare phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, my first gramophone only came with one sheet of paper with hieroglyphs showing how to connect certain components, all depicted through secret signs.</seg>
<seg id="7">When an internal part broke years later, I offered the paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew any panel.</seg>
<seg id="8">With a grin, he advised me what the labyrinthine paper was suitable for.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was a well-established aid during a chronic lack of toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="10">He playfully found the broken wire and allowed me to listen to my dear records again.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new age brought new instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even a relatively simple fruit juicer which just needed a grapefruit pressed down on it required about ten pictures.</seg>
<seg id="13">The drawing with a description of how to insert one piece into another was especially charming.</seg>
<seg id="14">It came in two parts, and there was no other possible procedure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Doing it the other way round required a considerable effort and involved breaking the plastic parts.</seg>
<seg id="16">My contempt for instructions ended with my Seat Leon.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 2003 production year still had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including replacing the indicator light.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simple.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a total of three steps, the job should have been done.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that, while the light bulb was was replaced in just three steps:</seg>
<seg id="21">1. Remove the cover.</seg>
<seg id="22">2. Unscrew the broken bulb and screw in a new one.</seg>
<seg id="23">3. Put the cover back.</seg>
<seg id="24">the bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the battery cover.</seg>
<seg id="25">At first I expected that inserting my upper right limb into the guts of the car would allow me to find a spring or a screw so I could detach the cover easily, and then I would follow points 1-3 suggested by the thrifty author of the service book.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing could be further from the truth.</seg>
<seg id="27">That cover had no place, no space for a slender Cinderella-esque hand, let alone that of an obese Silesian.</seg>
<seg id="28">I lost half an hour of my life with no success to show for it whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="29">The situation was further intensified by my wife entering the garage, summoned by the shouts and words she heard coming out of my mouth, very unusually.</seg>
<seg id="30">"What are you doing in here?" she asked ingenuously.</seg>
<seg id="31">My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms only two publishable words remain.</seg>
<seg id="32">I change the bulb.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Why is it taking you so long?" she asked, taking a chance with a sentence that might have been the last of a long-running volume.</seg>
<seg id="34">I explained the problem to her slowly, emphasising how I would torture the author of the manual, where the hot iron would burn the hand that wrote it, so that it could finally never write anything else. It was a mere introduction to the wide range of instructions from the film Witchhammer, including a specially commissioned bonfire on the knoll above Losinský castle.</seg>
<seg id="35">"What about removing the box?" my wife hypothesised over the extrication of the battery.</seg>
<seg id="36">In utter despair, I tried it and then steps 1-3 were as easy and fast as on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="37">I thought that nothing could surprise me.</seg>
<seg id="38">That was until the day I received a phone call from a colleague who was on the verge of collapse after being monitored by two officers from the State Drug Control Service.</seg>
<seg id="39">I know him as a composed colleague who has experienced both the possible and impossible in the field and who is able to recount wild stories in an unpeturbed voice.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Imagine being fined for not having a guide to washing your hands," he said in a feeble voice.</seg>
<seg id="41">I gradually pieced together the whole issue, which lay in the fact that he had no pictorial instructions on how to wash hands over the washbasin on the toilet used by patient.</seg>
<seg id="42">The argument he submitted to the committee official was that adults usually wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to explain a habitual procedure carried out by decent people. It did not have the desired effect on her, however, and cost him a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="43">"That is not the case," she told him.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was given to understand that the simple rinsing of lathery palms with flowing water is a primitive act at the Cro-magnon level, and that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, must perform this ceremony in ten steps.</seg>
<seg id="45">As such, it is necessary to inform people that they must release the water from out of the tap.</seg>
<seg id="46">The entire process has a total of eleven stages, but at the end you are rewarded by the joyous knowledge that you have washed your hands exactly as instructed by the State Institute for Drug Control.</seg>
<seg id="47">I have to say that by the end I was inspired and prepared a detailed plan for activities on the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="48">In terms of defecation, the procedure is unified and doesn't cause any problems. However, due to certain differences between the sexes, with urination it is necessary to give two sets of instructions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The problem remains the pictograms, because creating the perfect procedure requires an exact sketch of all the anatomical details, which could provoke a certain outrage among prudish toilet users, despite the fact that they can finally learn that they have been wiping their opening the wrong way their whole life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.</seg>

<seg id="4">Few people know, however, that the shooting of the music video in Russia did not go without a hitch, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it did not go flawlessly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The song Sara is very emotional and is about an unhappy affair between two lovers.</seg>
<seg id="7">To make the scenes dramatic, in the video the singer's adversary had to punch him</seg>

<seg id="1">Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown</seg>
<seg id="2">Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.</seg>
<seg id="5">Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?</seg>
<seg id="6">Best of luck to you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="2">Their car was recently found in the depths of the Volga.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two young Russians, Ilja Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, had been missing since December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">An extensive search for them was carried out, but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police eventually ended the search because of the lack of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The families of the missing couple lived not knowing whether they would ever find out what happened to them.</seg>

<seg id="1">New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump threatens the President of Mexico over the phone.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto this January, American President Donald Trump threatened that he wouldn't meet him if he publicly stated that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the conversation, Trump said that he would arrange the financing somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="4">Similarly, Trump also spoke openly to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.</seg>
<seg id="5">This has emerged from transcripts of the talks published by the US daily The Washington Post on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border with Mexico a major promise in his campaign last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Trump's first interview with the Mexican President shortly after he took office, he undiplomatically rebuked Peña Nieta for criticising his wall-building plan.</seg>
<seg id="8">He described the country's southern neighbour as a growing political problem, and urged the Mexican president not to publicly state that his government would never pay for the wall.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You cannot say that to the press," Trump repeatedly urged in a discussion on 27 January, and threatened to break off contacts with the Mexican President if he continued to issue defiant statements.</seg>
<seg id="10">He will figure out the funding somehow and it will work out eventually.</seg>
<seg id="11">"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall then I don't want to meet you anymore, because it is unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American daily.</seg>
<seg id="12">He then claimed that the wall was as the least significant thing they would talk about, but politically it is probably the most important.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump issued the executive order to build the wall shortly after coming to power.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mexico is rejecting the construction and financing of a 3200-kilometre-long wall, and the relations between the two countries have become critical.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the end of March, Trump said that the United States would pay for the project.</seg>
<seg id="16">Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.</seg>
<seg id="18">The head of the White House said that the conversation was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="19">This was the outcome of an exchange of views on the agreement that will see Australia grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in the Pacific Island states.</seg>
<seg id="20">At first Trump considered the deal to be absurd, but later conceded to it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you created, but you will have to stick to it," Trump told Turnbull.</seg>
<seg id="22">In some parts, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump approved of Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.</seg>
<seg id="23">"You're worse than me," joked Trump.</seg>
<seg id="24">The tone of the conversation suddenly got sharper.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="26">They're bad, I can assure you.</seg>
<seg id="27">That's why they're in prison now.</seg>
<seg id="28">"They're not going to be great people who go to work for the local dairy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">During the conversation, he also said that a fugitive could become the Boston terrorist in five years.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trump had telephone conversations with a large number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House. He often spoke to several leaders in a single day.</seg>
<seg id="31">The call with Turnbull finally proved to be the least pleasant for the whole day.</seg>
<seg id="32">Before he finished, he stressed that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rana's killer was executed before a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="2">Her father also watched.</seg>
<seg id="3">The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighbourhood, as his victim.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl and took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">He then raped her body, which he tossed near a mosque.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young girl's violent death affected the entire country, which is currently facing the threat of civil war.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yahya Almatari was in the first row of a thousand-person crowd, which gathered together to witness the execution.</seg>
<seg id="9">Muhammad al Maghrabi was condemned under Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.</seg>
<seg id="11">I feel a new person.</seg>
<seg id="12">It felt like a weight was lifted.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is a new day in my life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Other members of the family were also present, shouting the slogan "long live justice" along with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rapist was brought to the square in a police van, which he was then dragged out of.</seg>
<seg id="16">The police officers tied him around his waist.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the members turned his weapon against him, firing a shot from the immediate vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The crowd present celebrated each round that was fired.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Justice, Allah and Sharia Law have won," he added.</seg>
<seg id="21">I stood on Liberation Square in Sanaa and waited for the execution of my daughter's murderer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then the whole family went to the morgue.</seg>
<seg id="23">We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both my wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would succumb to hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch him.</seg>
<seg id="26">The execution was ordered by a court under the law of the Shiite Houthis.</seg>
<seg id="27">Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 lashes when he was arrested, but his actions provoked such outrage that the judge decided to apply the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="28">Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on 27 June.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rana's family knew him well.</seg>
<seg id="30">When the police searched the cellar of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his actions.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.</seg>
<seg id="32">What could his motivation have been?</seg>
<seg id="33">Even a beast would have been more merciful to Rana.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Our family has no enemies, and the wounds sustained by Rana's body were awful," he told the media.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, and we informed the police the same day. We told the newspapers and all the TV stations, and there posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is generally believed the police got a tip off from the murderer's parents, who suspected their son of the atrocity.</seg>
<seg id="37">Jamileh, the girl's mother, had to be hospitalised after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.</seg>
<seg id="38">Rana had gone out to play with the other children in the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="39">I went to see where she was 10-15 minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="40">We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.</seg>
<seg id="41">We walked around our block. Our friends took their cars and drove around, but our search was in vain.</seg>
<seg id="42">The residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.</seg>
<seg id="43">A representative of the Ministry of Justice read out a report of the investigation into the crowd to appease them.</seg>
<seg id="44">The accused apparently showed no regret for his actions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Police officers read out the sentence just before the deed was carried out, but the convict only glanced at his executioner briefly.</seg>
<seg id="46">The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings were also shared on the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal</seg>
<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CzechTrade national commission is won by František Savov's company, who is prosecuted by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2">The public commission by the CzechTrade state export agency was given to František Savov's publishing house Mladá fronta.</seg>
<seg id="3">The officials gave him full points for all the qualitative criteria.</seg>
<seg id="4">They did not mind the fact that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="5">The export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, announced a public tender for the four-year provision of editorial content for BusinessInfo in April.</seg>
<seg id="6">The commission was awarded to entrepreneur František Savov of the Mladá fronta publishing house and has a total value of 30.8 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="7">However the Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and has been pursuing him in absentia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic has called for his extradition.</seg>
<seg id="9">The case was noted on the server Aktualne.cz.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to CzechTrade's basic criteria, 60% of the decision to award the contract was based on the price offered and the 40% on the appeal and quality of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Savov's company was substantially helped by the second criterion.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to information from Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all the parts referring to the qualitative criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was this result that put it ahead of the second-best candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.</seg>
<seg id="14">While Mladá fronta operated on the basis of 404,900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="15">Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received below-average scores from the judges for all qualitative criteria, with a total of 62 points.</seg>
<seg id="16">Other organisations that took part in the tender include the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which is part of the Economia publishing house, like the Aktuálně.cz server.</seg>
<seg id="17">The VLM publishing company has issued several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.</seg>
<seg id="18">After their rejection, they decided to contest the outcome with the ÚOHS Úřadu pro ochranu hospodářské soutěže (Office for the Protection of Competitions).</seg>
<seg id="19">It believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The claimant is convinced that the contracting authority made the decision on the selection of a public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta at the expense of the claimant and other suppliers," reads the motion for the opening of proceedings submitted to the ÚOHS this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of VLM, the selection committee's scores appear unjustified, and the 100% evaluation of Mladá fronta by all its members extremely suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Every independent observer must consider such miraculous success on the part of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," said Klima.</seg>
<seg id="23">CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The CzechTrade agency will not comment on the public commissions until they are closed, on principle.</seg>
<seg id="25">All the information about the above contract is lawfully published in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the public tender notice.</seg>

<seg id="27">Mladá fronta responded with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic for Economia publishing house to release an article on Aktuálně.cz relating to a competition concerning its own business interests.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, that fact was mentioned in the article.</seg>
<seg id="29">They may have been helped in the tender by the fact that they provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years.</seg>
<seg id="30">The competition was first launched in 2013 when the Department of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba of the ODS party.</seg>
<seg id="31">The police accuses František Savov of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions for his companies, which caused the Czech state damages of up to 770 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Czech Republic has been requesting Great Britain for his extradition since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to Savov, the person behind his criminalisation is head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose sphere of influence includes the Mafra publishing house.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last year a London court dismissed Savov's claim against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, and we have not received any notification from the UK yet," Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition to the ownership of Mladá Fronta, Savov was part of the Harvestor Limited firm, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund and buys up failing businesses.</seg>
<seg id="37">It should also control Heavier Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the past Savov was also associated with the seizing of property from the former Socialist Youth Organisation.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1">Sparta midfielder Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to keep believing.</seg>
<seg id="2">Sixteen thousand fans were up on their feet applauding.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tomáš Rosický goes to ground.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was the same scene as the Sunday match against the Bohemians.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sparta midfielder livened up the game against Red Star Belgrade and set up several goals, but his teammates couldn't convert them in the end.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pumped up by new multi-million reinforcements, the team from Letná ended up in the second round of the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Was it hard to make something out of the match after the goal by Belgrade?</seg>
<seg id="8">After the goal was scored, we needed to score four, which was difficult for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">We wanted to avoid losing at least, so as to build up our self-confidence to get something out of it for the next match.</seg>
<seg id="10">We had several chances.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to work together as a team and bring our game forward.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why did it take Sparta so long to come into the match?</seg>
<seg id="13">The match was terribly overworked.</seg>
<seg id="14">Out opposing teams combinations were much better than ours.</seg>
<seg id="15">We didn't get anywhere, and we'd only had one shot by half time.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of course, that's very little when you have to win by two or three goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">The second half was much better, and in the final third we managed to play at their level.</seg>
<seg id="18">But you have to push your opponents into these positions more often.</seg>
<seg id="19">Was the high number of changes to the configuration a problem?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, this is one of the pains you have to deal with when a new team is formed.</seg>
<seg id="21">We had only played three matches together and the configuration is still changing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The coach needs to find the ideal 11 that fit together.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it encouraging for you to have played for part of two matches in a row?</seg>
<seg id="24">They're still just parts of the match.</seg>
<seg id="25">I myself don't know how my position will develop and when I will be able to play from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="26">Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place within Sparta?</seg>
<seg id="27">We have to be, otherwise it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the same as with injuries.</seg>
<seg id="29">If you don't have faith, then you can't go back.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sparta made a decision and we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fans came back in large numbers, but when they left they were embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="32">What can you tell them?</seg>
<seg id="33">It was another great away trip, just like with the Bohemians.</seg>
<seg id="34">I'm really sorry that we couldn't make them happy with a better performance.</seg>
<seg id="35">I would like to give them a reason to come to the next one.</seg>
<seg id="36">We can thank them for coming.</seg>
<seg id="37">They won't remember these trips when it's been 15 years since I played here.</seg>
<seg id="38">Can a cupless season be at least an advantage for the league?</seg>
<seg id="39">At the moment we're fighting against ourselves. We will keep playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.</seg>

<seg id="1">An entrepreneur is facing ten years in jail for extreme tax avoidance.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint from businessman Jiří Toman, who is to due spend ten years behind bars for tax avoidance.</seg>
<seg id="3">The calculated damage amounts to 645 million Czech crowns.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his complaint, Toman claimed that that the justice violated his fundamental rights, stating that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are not entirely complete.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the Constitutional Judges found the complaint to be unjustified, as CTK learned from the court database.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Constitutional Court is not a court of appeal.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It cannot assess the factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the ordinary courts for a fourth time if it does not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Toman was tried as a fugitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">The verdict took effect in November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.</seg>
<seg id="10">Toman was in custody in Argentina, where he was found at the time of the decision by the Constitutional Court.</seg>
<seg id="11">The penalty imposed is in the higher end of the statutory limitations, which corresponds to the damage incurred according to the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="12">The High Court described the case as extreme tax evasion that had a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="13">The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the company World Servis from 2005 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">The damages of 645 million Czech crowns only refer to the period from January to July 2008, and according to an expert the total evasion exceeded one billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">For procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the full amount.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the charges, World Servis did not include complete invoices in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties to the order of at least tens of millions of Czech crowns, the company only paid taxes amounting to just a few hundred thousand.</seg>
<seg id="18">World Servis and some of the companies it has done business with are related to entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who has been charged with 13 years in jail for VAT fraud over driving matters.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Constitutional Court also dismissed his complaint.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="2">So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="6">By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="8">At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the core stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="13">As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="17">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="20">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).</seg>
<seg id="22">And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.</seg>
<seg id="23">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="24">At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian athletes have not had their ban on starting lifted by the IAAF.</seg>
<seg id="2">During its congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation upheld the international ban preventing the Russian athletes from starting because of the state-sponsored doping programme.</seg>
<seg id="3">The result vote regarding the world championships, which begin on Friday, was unambiguous, as expected.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prolongation of the ban was approved by 166 delegates, with only 21 votes opposing it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main reason for the rejection is that Russia has failed to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted by Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group.</seg>
<seg id="6">His group recommended that the ban be upheld.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some older doping cases remain unresolved, as a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches with a compromised reputation are still working in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA is not yet fully operational, and does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, RUSADA may undergo testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, meaning Russian athletes were not able to attend last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="12">Despite the ban on the upcoming international championships, 19 Russians who have previously proved they have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time will participate.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, they will not be able to start championships wearing the national colours, and in the event of a victory, the Russian anthem will not be played.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States are breaking apart.</seg>
<seg id="2">The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.</seg>
<seg id="3">California has declared a ban on its citizens traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.</seg>
<seg id="4">The state of Tennessee has hit back and has issued a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, and US citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rather, California has forbidden spending state money for its citizens to travel to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Who will stop this madness?</seg>
<seg id="8">California is strongly pro LGBT, and any disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is seen as discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="9">By contrast, Tennessee has issued an exception to the law stating that if a psychotherapist has a moral issue with treating patients from the LGBT community, they are not required to provide the therapy themselves and can find the patients another therapist who does not have a problem with it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Texas and other states have in turn adopted laws under which religious charities that are given children for adoption by their mothers are not required to give these children to same-sex couples.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has placed a ban on funding its citizens' journeys to eight states from its own means.</seg>
<seg id="12">In practice, this means that Californian professors are not allowed to travel to scientific symposiums in Texas with funding from their universities, for example, because they are co-financed by the state of California.</seg>
<seg id="13">Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in Tennessee, for example, with the financial support of their schools.</seg>
<seg id="14">To fund the trips, they must either get federal grants, although it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travels of citizens from State A to State B, or else private sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state of Tennessee has suffered and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it doesn't like the Californian policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, yet it will not place an embargo on travelling to California because of it.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is placing the embargo as retaliation for the California embargo on Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="17">It will do the same to any state of the Union that orders a similar travel ban to another state, whatever the reason.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, it called on the parliaments of all the states to stop this madness.</seg>
<seg id="19">The above is all fact, and now for a commentary.</seg>
<seg id="20">The situation is toxic.</seg>
<seg id="21">First of all, all of this is constitutional. No part of it is unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="22">States have the right to enforce conscientious objection laws, as well as to decide what their money can be spent on and what it cannot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Secondly, what's wrong with conscientious objection?</seg>
<seg id="24">When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't they just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?</seg>
<seg id="25">Why should they be forced to sell pork under penalty of punishment if there are already enough butchers offering pork?</seg>
<seg id="26">In Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or cakes that contain alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="28">Why punish him and not just leave him alone and let the cakes be ordered from the hundreds of other bakers?</seg>
<seg id="29">Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all federal citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies with non-federal powers, that is, according to the preferences of their inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then there are variety, multiplicity and diversity.</seg>
<seg id="31">California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.</seg>
<seg id="32">But California wants California to be California, and Texas and seven other states to also be California!</seg>
<seg id="33">Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately fought for their lifestyle to be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of live and let live, which all reasonable people ought to follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.</seg>
<seg id="37">They are the modern enemies of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="38">Fifth, I do not know of any situation in US history when states have done this for political reasons except this case.</seg>
<seg id="39">States did not even impose sanctions on one another in times of struggle for civil rights for black people, where the North and West were on the side of integration, and the South on the side of segregation.</seg>
<seg id="40">The only case was the in 1950s, and the political cause was slavery, and the war by the North against the South.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of course, nothing like that is happening now, but the situation is still toxic.</seg>
<seg id="42">The cultural and political divide between the blue Democratic states and the red Republican states is widening, and the US is disconnecting internally on a mental level.</seg>

<seg id="2">A critic of Putin received a hefty fine.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny received a fine of 300 thousand roubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">A court imposed a fine on him for calling on people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Navalny has organised two large anti-government street protests over the past two months, and announced that he is setting his sights on the head of state position in March next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Current head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.</seg>
<seg id="7">Navalny said that the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was fined for calling people to demonstrations through videos on the YouTube internet portal.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fine is 300 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Later, we'll take it off the judge's salary," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not take part in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, Navalny, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, believes the judgment to be politically motivated.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the 300,000 roubles, on Thursday the court also imposed fines 25,000 roubles on two members of Navalny's pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.</seg>
<seg id="14">Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figured on the fragmented opposition scene.</seg>
<seg id="15">The authorities are trying to defend themselves against Naval any way they can.</seg>
<seg id="16">In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from the Kirovles forestry company.</seg>
<seg id="17">The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeals in May.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ruling is so final that it prevents Navalny from nominating himself under Russian law.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brothers fight over $500 million property empire</seg>
<seg id="2">Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">It sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="10">A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.</seg>
<seg id="15">Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="20">They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="22">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="26">Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="30">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."</seg>
<seg id="32">On Friday, that hope appeared gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heatwave in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2">Teachers hose down children.</seg>
<seg id="3">Public transport drivers carry water and wear summer clothes.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 35 children who attend the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4 are only able to go outside in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="5">The school has just been renovated and the recently planted trees do not provide much shade yet.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no pool there, but the teachers cool children down with a sprinkler.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the afternoon, the children stay in the classroom, where the blinds and curtains are drawn.</seg>
<seg id="8">They also try to cool down the air with a purifier as they do not have air conditioning.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is challenging for both the teachers and the cooks.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The indoor and outdoor temperatures exceed the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not really have been operating at that time," said Miloslava Makovičková, the school director.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is a glass corridor in the nursery where the temperature reaches around 40 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="12">We ventilate in the morning around 6:00. We close the windows and we have blinds on the southern sides that protect us.</seg>
<seg id="13">"But it doesn't help much," she added.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are better conditions at the Na Hrázi forest kindergarten in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have fully grown trees on the land, so we can stay underneath them.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have a beautiful walnut tree with a table under it, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the director of the kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="17">Teachers try to go into the woods with the kids, where there is a more shade.</seg>
<seg id="18">The children wear damp caps and there are various kinds of water sports on the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have a hand-operated sprinkler that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering the children," said Kompanová.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jitka Vilimovská, the headmaster of the nursery school in Novoborská ulice in the Prosek area of Prague, said that teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have a fairly developed garden, so they can stay under the trees," she said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The go outside in the morning and then after 15:00.</seg>
<seg id="23">Every child must have something covering their head.</seg>
<seg id="24">Teachers also remind children that they should drink.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, they can choose between slightly sweetened tea or diluted juice, and they drink water in the garden.</seg>
<seg id="26">They also eat green salad every day, and their snacks always include fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes brought by their parents.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, one mum brought about a ten-kilo melon for the kids today," Makovičková added.</seg>
<seg id="28">Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.</seg>
<seg id="29">The DPP transport company in Prague is providing them with water, ionised drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.</seg>
<seg id="30">The tram and bus drivers' cabins are air conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the cabins, the passenger compartments of some trams are also air conditioned.</seg>
<seg id="32">The tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high-temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="33">Small damage occurred in a circuit in Hostivař.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the current high temperatures, we must pay particular attention to make sure that a sufficient number of drinks are available to the drivers.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Chilled drinking water is available on all routes, exchange points and depots," said Řehková.</seg>
<seg id="36">At some depots and exchange points, workers also have access to so-called "sodobars", which dispense cold soda.</seg>
<seg id="37">Drivers also receive soluble ionic beverages as a preventive measure.</seg>
<seg id="38">"They can also wear a summer uniform, which makes drivers more comfortable during their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.</seg>
<seg id="39">The hot, dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.</seg>
<seg id="40">On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic extinguished 108, which is twice the daily average.</seg>
<seg id="41">During the day on Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in putting out fires.</seg>
<seg id="42">"There are an especially high number of fires in the natural environment, which are associated with wildlife," said firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová.</seg>
<seg id="43">The firefighters were not even brought any relief evening by the changes in the weather in the evening, as in many places the heat was replaced by storms and torrential rain.</seg>
<seg id="44">Firefighters attended to 236 incidents in connection with thunderstorms.</seg>
<seg id="45">In particular, many of the calls required them to remove fallen trees and branches.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Central Bohemian region was most affected," Zaoralová continued.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the help of firefighters was also required in Stvolinek, Česká Lípa, where 60 people from the children's camp had to be evacuated to safety because of the storm.</seg>
<seg id="48">The tropical temperatures also created work for rescuers in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="49">On Tuesday and on Wednesday night, ambulances were called out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from boilers.</seg>
<seg id="50">As such, people should have their water heaters checked, rescue services warned.</seg>
<seg id="51">Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released through incomplete combustion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headaches and fainting.</seg>
<seg id="53">In case of suspected poisoning, you should leave the affected room.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="17">This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="2">Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="16">Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="2">A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.</seg>
<seg id="6">My son was my best friend."</seg>
<seg id="7">Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She ended his life to better her own.</seg>
<seg id="12">She has not accepted responsibility," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="14">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="16">A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="25">Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.</seg>
<seg id="26">The case has divided legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">D11, or how not to build a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="2">Can the motorways in the Czech Republic ever be finished?</seg>
<seg id="3">Here's a puzzle for you.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is unfinished, even though construction started in 1978.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even though it hasn't materialised, it is constantly being repaired.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can't be built, even though it has a building permit.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="8">Yes, that's right, motorway D11 to Hradec Králové.</seg>
<seg id="9">Construction on another section of it has recently halted by the Děti Země (Children of the Earth) movement for at least several months.</seg>
<seg id="10">We Eastern Bohemians are getting our motorway in pieces, like cutting slices off a salami.</seg>
<seg id="11">One round is sliced and then we have to wait and see if and when we'll get another.</seg>
<seg id="12">We're not asking for miracles, though.</seg>
<seg id="13">We just want to shorten driving times and to divert trucks going to or from Poland away from villages and towns.</seg>
<seg id="14">The endless streams of trucks go straight through the towns like Jaroměř or Náchod, which cannot be reasonably avoided.</seg>
<seg id="15">The final stretch of our dream motorway was begun in 2008, that is, an unbelievable nine years ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then, there hasn't been a modicum of progress.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, when construction began on the remaining four kilometres of the incomplete section to Hradec Králové and an archaeological survey was carried out other sections by Jaroměř, with works due to begin at the end of this year, you could hear corks being popped loudly in Eastern Bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="18">At this point, nobody believed it however.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last week it was announced that construction will not take place this year.</seg>
<seg id="20">And maybe not next year either.</seg>
<seg id="21">Děti Země, an organisation from Brno fighting for sustainable transport, has put a halt on the works.</seg>
<seg id="22">Děti Země is repeating its tactics from D1.</seg>
<seg id="23">They opposed the decision to grant the building permit in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="24">They are demanding a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, these include the City of Hradec Králové, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence and the Railway Authority.</seg>
<seg id="26">Meanwhile, not far from D11 we come across the village with the expressive name of Pohřebačka.</seg>
<seg id="27">We drive down, we simply continue along the motorway and all of a sudden we find ourselves on the side road next to it so we can join the line of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worst part is that you can see similar stories across the country.</seg>
<seg id="29">There's the terrifying, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorways.</seg>
<seg id="30">Everyone has their own Pohřebačka.</seg>
<seg id="31">What did Děti Země request?</seg>
<seg id="32">What is the at the heart of the problems with road construction in the Czech Republic?</seg>
<seg id="33">And why is motorway network practically impossible to finish within the current system?</seg>

<seg id="1">Provence lavender under threat from climate change</seg>
<seg id="2">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5">This affects the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."</seg>
<seg id="7">And a lot is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have fewer parts with essential oil."</seg>
<seg id="11">Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="102">Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="105">A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="106">The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.</seg>
<seg id="107">From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.</seg>
<seg id="108">The front page would have to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="109">Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.</seg>
<seg id="110">Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.</seg>
<seg id="111">If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="112">Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="113">"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="44">The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.</seg>
<seg id="45">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="46">The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can count the scales on its sole.'</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">We have nothing to lose but our chains."</seg>

<seg id="1">A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2">In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.</seg>
<seg id="7">By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="14">And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.</seg>
<seg id="15">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="17">That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="20">In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."</seg>
<seg id="21">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="22">By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="23">"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.</seg>
<seg id="24">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."</seg>
<seg id="25">The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.</seg>
<seg id="26">It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="28">"So never shut up."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I get goosebumps still talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="31">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."</seg>

<seg id="1">Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide</seg>
<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="3">"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="4">The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="16">RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police charge three people, one of whom is a minor.</seg>
<seg id="2">The police have charged three men with the setting up fire to a precious wooden church in Třinec-Guty, Frýdek-Místek on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the accused is a juvenile, and all three are Czech nationals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Punishment for the crime could be as much as 15 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moravian-Silesian police chief Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his view, it was a deliberate crime.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is a very fresh matter, and the police are currently working on the motive for the whole incident," said Kužel.</seg>
<seg id="8">He stated the police would discuss the possibility of taking the accused into custody.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not disclose any further information.</seg>
<seg id="10">"At present, I can't tell you any more about it because the Criminal Police and Investigation Service are working on things, as is the state prosecutor, who is supervising the proceedings," said Kužel.</seg>
<seg id="11">The wooden church of the "Body of God" in Gute dates back to the 16th century</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a valuable monument with many original decorations and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.</seg>
<seg id="13">The tangible damages will amount to tens of millions of Czech crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Questions were raised about the restoration of the church shortly after the fire began.</seg>
<seg id="15">The majority of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, and the Ministry of Culture and the municipality are ready to pay extra costs. A public collection is also being prepared, and they are counting on contributions from the landowner, which is the local parish.</seg>
<seg id="16">The similar 16th century wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">At that time, it was caused by an electrical installation.</seg>
<seg id="18">An exact copy was created in its place.</seg>

<seg id="1">The state is counting on its citizens to defend the country.</seg>
<seg id="2">It will support their training.</seg>
<seg id="3">By offering financial support for the state-sponsored organisations, the aim of the law on citizens' preparedness for defence of the state is counting on voluntary shooting training, or teams of trainers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Ministry of Defence, which has been assigned the role by the government, promises to improve the physical fitness and capabilities of the Czechs, so that they could then be used in crisis situations.</seg>
<seg id="5">This results from the proposal prepared by the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Were the law to be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support its defence.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to make Czech Republic's population better prepared to defend the state, outside of military duties and on the basis of voluntary activities.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the state would support ham radio, shooting or dog training societies financially or materially, boosting the capabilities of their members.</seg>
<seg id="9">In return, it would get information about people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis, and about their abilities or material equipment.</seg>
<seg id="10">Accredited instructors would also be available to assist the associations and other interested parties in the training or education.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also includes the organisation of talks with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the possible options envisage a new office that would be created to administer and coordinate the project.</seg>
<seg id="13">The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation would be voluntary, and that the state would only use their skills if a state of emergency was declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The whole concept must respect the gradual elimination of the previously clear boundaries between the different types of threats," the proposal states, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ministry clerks noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, and not just military skills.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The basic aim of the proposal is to create a very broad foundation that will enable every citizen to respond properly in the event of situations that endanger the sovereignty, lives, health or property of individuals, to protect themselves or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to perform the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the proposal specifies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adopting the law would necessitate considerable financial demands.</seg>
<seg id="18">The exact amount depend on the option chosen, according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, the department envisages up to 100 million crowns being provided as financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state.</seg>
<seg id="20">If an administrative and coordination centre were to be established, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns a year.</seg>
<seg id="21">More money would be required to pay wages or create an IT system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The proposal also suggests that the regional military headquarters should to expand, employing a total of 42 more soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ministry officials previously stated that the law would also help resolve the certain Czech politicians' objections to the introduction of the European Union directive concerning the possession of arms.</seg>
<seg id="24">If adopted, it would allow gun enthusiasts who are part of the system to retain weapons that the directive would otherwise forbid.</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Thursday becomes the hottest day</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, temperatures of 38.3 degrees were recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín, making it the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="3">It surpassed Tuesday, which had previously been the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement was made by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.</seg>
<seg id="5">Elsewhere, however, many of the temperature records set on Tuesday did not fall on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The heatwave mainly affected Moravia, while in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only nine long-term measuring stations saw new records set on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day was the same as the previous record set in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Lednice, near Břeclav, the day time temperature reached 37.4 degrees, surpassing the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice near Brno the current temperature of 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.</seg>
<seg id="11">Both records was last broken in 2013, like in Strážnice.</seg>
<seg id="12">The high temperatures mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="13">After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the highest daytime temperatures in western and northwest Bohemia were only about 22 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, temperatures in Moravia will mostly remain high on Friday, and also on Saturday in the southeast of Moravia.</seg>

<seg id="1">A malady has spread here.</seg>
<seg id="2">It isn't enough for billionaires to have the same voice as other mere legal adults in the country during elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">They want to adjudicate directly, and because not all of them are as bold as Andrel Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Along with other colleagues behind Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, Penta owner Marek Dospiva sponsors Robejšek's Realisty.</seg>
<seg id="5">The second life of the Občanské demokratické aliance (Civic Democratic Alliance) is funded by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman</seg>
<seg id="6">Convicted corrupter and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta bought up the Strana soukromníků (Freeholder Party).</seg>
<seg id="7">The Agrofert political movement, as the project by Andrej Babiš unintentionally named by the Mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, deserves a whole chapter for itself.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Starostové a nezávislí (Mayors and Independents - STAN) recently acquired their own billionaire.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man in question is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the security equipment company Jablotron.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his own words, he entered politics to do good.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dědek's entrance in mayoral colours did not get off to a good start, however.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="13">Which is to say that my goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement to get 20 percent in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="14">Various people smiled to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dědek's slip of the tongue is rather symptomatic, however.</seg>
<seg id="16">Millionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although he intends to run for election for the Starostové, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dědek supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and cannot handle the lively rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.</seg>
<seg id="20">He certainly is not going into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.</seg>
<seg id="21">Babiš will remain a hero to me.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is willing to step out of his world, which he has under control, and do something for all of us.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shortly after the Starostové introduced him as a new reinforcement, he professed his admiration for Babiš once again.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said he wanted the Starostové to learn to imagine a possible collaboration with Babiš.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some people may appreciate the fact that Dědek sticks to his opinions and stands up for himself, no matter what team colours he is wearing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so awkward to the Starostové to create a second rate version.</seg>
<seg id="27">Others still may ask whether the boss of Jablotron parted ways from the boss of Agrofert as part of a bad business deal, and is now looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.</seg>
<seg id="28">Dědek's first public appearances did not all revolve around Babiš, however.</seg>
<seg id="29">Dědek promised to send the Starostové ten million crowns for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="30">And when they say they need more money, he will send more.</seg>
<seg id="31">A few years ago, it would have been very hard for someone to take exception to such a statement.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, before the 2010 elections the legally recognised crook Zdeněk Bakala gave away millions to all the parties.</seg>
<seg id="33">The political division of Vit Bárta's security agency, TOP 09, and the Civic Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are now living in different times, however.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to a political party.</seg>
<seg id="36">When Dědek entered politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="37">Perhaps then he would not have had to ask why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.</seg>
<seg id="38">Dědek's first days in politics were topped off with a proposal to give tax benefits to families with children who are studying.</seg>
<seg id="39">People with a university education earn about 50,000 crowns per month in our country.</seg>
<seg id="40">Those with only basic education earn less than 20,000.</seg>
<seg id="41">Someone earning 50,000 is rich under the local conditions.</seg>
<seg id="42">Those earning 20,000 are poor.</seg>
<seg id="43">In Dědek's view, the poor pay taxes fairly, and the rich should enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, in which they participate very little.</seg>
<seg id="44">In short, rich people must be helped so that they do not have to face poverty.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Starostové can congratulate themselves for their new acquisition and Babis is rubbing his hands.</seg>
<seg id="46">Thanks to Dědek, the rest of us can confirm the fact that billionaires are not good people.</seg>
<seg id="47">The question remains of who to vote for.</seg>
<seg id="48">To my mind, it should be those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.</seg>
<seg id="49">It should be the people who don't employ their own party members or citizens of the state and who don't own parts of the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">Finally, it should be the people who want everyone to live well in a rich country, and not just the few.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.</seg>
<seg id="2">He had to reduce the price of his villa complex by 234 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">Selling real estate isn't always easy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Often, it isn't even helped by having 11 bedrooms and a wonderful view of the sea, or by the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="5">When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price had to be reduced by a staggering £8 million.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Mirror.co.uk reported on the sale.</seg>
<seg id="7">The brochure describing the lots states: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."</seg>
<seg id="8">You missed out on a place like no other.</seg>
<seg id="9">But not even a connection between the the real estate company and the US president could support an extreme price tag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Donald Trump had to slash the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible £8 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">The original price of the property was £21.5 million, but the final price dropped to £13 million.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even after the discount, the price of the villa complex is equivalent to about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="13">And no wonder.</seg>
<seg id="14">It consists of amazing 5-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, with 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.</seg>
<seg id="15">It includes several buildings.</seg>
<seg id="16">Part of the property has a swimming pool and a tennis court.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are dozens of palms planted on the plot.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is a wonderful view of the sea from the terrace.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now the estate is closer to normal property prices on the island.</seg>
<seg id="21">Trump bought the property in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to speculations, he is thought to have paid about £15 million.</seg>
<seg id="23">He bought it as a rental property.</seg>
<seg id="24">Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin,</seg>
<seg id="25">but now with the new price, it is in second place.</seg>
<seg id="26">Another property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>

<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will have security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">We'll do the best we can with what we got.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm not going to worry too much about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We have a plan in place."</seg>

<seg id="1">Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news</seg>
<seg id="2">Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.</seg>
<seg id="4">Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.</seg>
<seg id="8">She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.</seg>

<seg id="1">Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story</seg>
<seg id="2">In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"That's his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="10">And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.</seg>
<seg id="11">To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="13">For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="15">He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."</seg>
<seg id="17">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."</seg>
<seg id="19">Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just let it go, guys!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe the two are connected?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="28">Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."</seg>
<seg id="29">With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="31">But Scotney holds a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I was sad to leave," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"</seg>

<seg id="1">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned</seg>
<seg id="2">Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yep.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sex robots are a big deal right now.</seg>
<seg id="5">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.</seg>
<seg id="8">"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also has moods during the day just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="18">She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"</seg>
<seg id="19">There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.</seg>
<seg id="20">On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.</seg>
<seg id="26">And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.</seg>
<seg id="30">The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="33">They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.</seg>
<seg id="35">They are pleasant slaves, in other words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.</seg>

<seg id="2">Curry is fighting to make the cut in California.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite messing up his first shot, star basketball player Stephen Curry made it through the first round between professional golfers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two-time holder of the record for the most-valuable NBA player took part in the Egoie Mae Classic, a lower series run by Web.com Tour in Hayward, California. He ended his first round with 74 shots and will keep fighting to make the cut.</seg>
<seg id="5">Golden State point guard, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously, and his first shot ended up in the drink holder of a golf cart parked at the fairway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even after that, he was not as accurate as on the basketball court, but he had a dozen professionals behind him on the scoreboard with four-over-par.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It wasn't the ideal way to get started, to have to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it settled down a bit," said Curry about his enormous stage fright.</seg>
<seg id="8">I very nervous when I took the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If you'd told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the round, I'd take that all day, every day," he added.</seg>
<seg id="10">If Curry is able to make the cut, which is likely to be around two under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to prove themselves on the Web.com Tour.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the nerves, it might work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who had played in celebrity tournaments in the past, as well as mixed amateur and professional competitions.</seg>
<seg id="12">The event in Hayward is his first time starting in a tournament that falls under the PGA.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was granted a sponsor's exception to take part in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained amateur status.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's great feat?</seg>
<seg id="2">Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="3">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="7">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="14">I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="16">While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="17">The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.</seg>
<seg id="18">So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="25">The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.</seg>

<seg id="23">We've been together three years, and we'll get married next year.</seg>
<seg id="24">So I brought something back with me.</seg>
<seg id="25">How challenging is the KHL for goalkeepers?</seg>
<seg id="26">The top ten teams are really high quality.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there are teams like us or Slovan, which have to change their playing style against them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The other side have the skills, so you have to compensate for it with something.</seg>
<seg id="29">That means playing more towards the rear, fighting more.</seg>
<seg id="30">I did not see any problems in the width of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="31">The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty space.</seg>
<seg id="32">They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to keep playing.</seg>
<seg id="33">They shoot more in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Did you have any problems travelling and shifting between seven time zones?</seg>
<seg id="35">If you don't have a family it's not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="36">You can sleep in peace.</seg>
<seg id="37">The schedule is normally arranged so that you play around four away matches and then you get two days off.</seg>
<seg id="38">How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?</seg>
<seg id="39">Like a national team.</seg>
<seg id="40">All of Latvia follows ice hockey, it's the national sport along with basketball.</seg>
<seg id="41">Everyone supports them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even when things were going badly, a lot of people would come.</seg>
<seg id="43">Did Dinamo's activities in the KHL help Latvia to move to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?</seg>
<seg id="44">The KHL has been going since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="45">Their results at the World Championships started to improve from that time.</seg>
<seg id="46">They only just lost 1:2 in the quarterfinals against Canada at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="47">It was an unbelievable result for them.</seg>
<seg id="48">They've reached a higher level thanks to the KHL.</seg>
<seg id="49">More and more Latvian players are setting their sights on the Czech Extraliga.</seg>
<seg id="50">Roberts Bukarts made it to Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign a contract.</seg>
<seg id="51">Why is it that so many of them go there?</seg>
<seg id="52">They're not second rate players, they're high quality.</seg>
<seg id="53">Our local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians included.</seg>
<seg id="54">It's a natural progression.</seg>
<seg id="55">The KHL starts in three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="56">Why is it that you still don't have a position?</seg>
<seg id="57">I knew that I wouldn't stay in Riga since the beginning of February.</seg>
<seg id="58">So, I started looking for something.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sparta was on the table.</seg>
<seg id="60">But since they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper we didn't come to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="61">It was classic.</seg>
<seg id="62">We spoke to various teams that ultimately went on to sign someone else.</seg>
<seg id="63">So now I'm training back home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.</seg>
<seg id="64">Aren't you nervous about that?</seg>
<seg id="65">I was four years ago, when I went away and didn't know how it would be.</seg>
<seg id="66">The current situation isn't exactly ideal, but on the other hand it means I can spend some time at home.</seg>
<seg id="67">I did some playing in the KHL, so I see it differently now.</seg>
<seg id="68">The question is when and where I'll sign.</seg>
<seg id="69">How likely is it that you'll start the new year in Zlín?</seg>
<seg id="70">Anything could happen.</seg>
<seg id="71">We'll see how things stand in a month.</seg>
<seg id="72">Now all I can do is wait to see what my agent arranges.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do you have a preference for a particular competition?</seg>
<seg id="74">Given how last season went, I'm not really in a position to choose.</seg>
<seg id="75">So I'm waiting for the phone to ring.</seg>

<seg id="1">The government trip to Lety continues.</seg>
<seg id="2">In January of this year I wrote about the camp at Lety, near Orlík in the article "With the Care of a Decent Manager?"</seg>
<seg id="3">The essence of the problem remains the same, and so I'll refer to the key passage of the article.</seg>
<seg id="4">There has been talk about the camp in Lety for many years.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the readers who do not know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural heritage site of Pietní místo Lety, for example.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, at the beginning of the historical overview, it states that the camp lay two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labour camp from 8 August 1940, as a displaced persons camp from 1 January 1942 and became a Roma camp on 2 August 1942.</seg>
<seg id="7">The text below this goes on to describe life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when Lety's first prisoners were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The overall total was 420.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a very sad history of enormous suffering on the part of human beings caused to them by human beings and perverse ideology.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is no question about the need to remember these events constantly.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is also no question that the remembrance should take place at the memorial located in the place where these people suffered.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem lies elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="14">During socialism, the camp was slightly forgotten about, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on the part of the former camp.</seg>
<seg id="15">The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was erected at Lety in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been governed by the Lidice Memorial.</seg>
<seg id="18">In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.</seg>
<seg id="19">These are facts about the camp's post-war fate in brief.</seg>
<seg id="20">At least, that was until autumn of this year, when the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to call an expert judgment to determine the price.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government is rumoured to buying the pig farm back after.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some figures, but I would probably upset the plans if I went to the public with them."</seg>
<seg id="23">We'll see what the expert opinion leads to.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to some unofficial estimates, it may amount to hundreds of millions, while according to others the price may reach up to a billion.</seg>
<seg id="25">In any case, it will definitely not be a cheap matter.</seg>
<seg id="26">And just a few hundred metres from the former camp is a memorial in which the state invested almost 10 million crowns in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even if the whole transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which obviously is not likely, in my opinion it would still be a waste of money.</seg>
<seg id="28">Doesn't the government have other priorities?</seg>
<seg id="29">The memorial, a solemn place of commemoration, stands there thanks to the will of history, almost in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to can go there to pay tribute to the memory of those who suffered and were killed.</seg>
<seg id="30">I don't see any reason to change it!</seg>
<seg id="31">Let's just leave it as it is, and maintain the site of reverence with the utmost care.</seg>
<seg id="32">The property, and now also the taxpayers' money, should be entrusted to a responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, to oversee it with the care of a dutiful manager.</seg>
<seg id="33">They should at least treat it as if it were their own company.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister do not represent the whole government.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, given the aforementioned facts, I feel that the leader of the ANO movement is only using it as an empty pre-election proclamation.</seg>
<seg id="36">This May I went directly to the place to see it.</seg>
<seg id="37">It has a good driveway, orderly parking and replicas of the wooden camp huts.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is an exhibition in one, and an integrated toilet with running water in another.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is a small, outdoor amphitheater with a seating area and a view of the memorial site, made from stones placed on a slight slope.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are a lot of flowers and wreaths.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the attributes correspond to the meaning of this place, and are suitable and appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="42">Archaeological research is currently taking place on the site of the original camp.</seg>
<seg id="43">It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible to preserve some of the uncovered foundations, for example, and at least make them accessible in an appropriate visual manner.</seg>
<seg id="44">Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could be focussing his efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="45">If he succeeds in pushing the government to buy a pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic time in the role of Minister of Culture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD</seg>
<seg id="2">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="5">While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'</seg>
<seg id="13">He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.</seg>
<seg id="15">She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="16">The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="25">Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."</seg>

<seg id="1">Chicken skin king Láďa Hruška is facing the challenge of his life.</seg>
<seg id="2">He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!</seg>
<seg id="3">This multifaceted picture began to emerge thanks to the new show "Zdeňkova akademie" on TV Prima.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hruška immediately grabbed his chance.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy, because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video shared on social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">And since the two of them have been quarrelling for several years, Láďa did not miss the opportunity to irritate afforded to him.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In return, I can teach you the Znojmo way of cooking chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to go canoeing and show you why fried cheese is a favourite," provoked Hruška.</seg>
<seg id="8">He's taking his participation in Pohlreich's new show very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's question of being a chef," he told Blesk.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show "Ano, šéfe!"</seg>
<seg id="12">Prima has only reacted to Hruška's participation in the cooking academy by treating the whole thing as his personal activity outside of television.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hruška dealt a severe blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first recipe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Within a few days, he had sold over 300 thousand copies!</seg>
<seg id="15">The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting schedule, is a fully fledged cooking school.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience, and will introduce them to 12 different cooking techniques across 12 episodes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last episode of his show "Teď vaří šéf" in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ("hruška" in Czech) ironed onto his shirt.</seg>
<seg id="18">If my face was there, I would laugh a lot.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I just smile over the pear - pears are healthy and full of vitamins," said Láďa.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has his own thoughts on Láďa's cooking.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Cooking according to Láďa Hruška isn't even considered at home, because I don't let gastropunks in my home," the chef said clearly.</seg>
<seg id="22">I highly appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich, even if he things I make chicken with honey.</seg>
<seg id="23">His recipe does not appear in my show, however," Hruška said, unforgivingly.</seg>
<seg id="24">He's a moron!</seg>
<seg id="25">If you ask me, he's no chef, he's a TV clown.</seg>
<seg id="26">"He's gastronomically illiterate or an imbecile," Pohlreich said of Hruška at one of the presentations.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I'm not going to throw my arms about like a 20 year-old, but I'm not going to try and resolve it any more," said Hruška, in response to the score of verbal insults.</seg>

<seg id="2">The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.</seg>
<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="8">In his pursuit of decent people and personalities that will potentially replace some of the mayors as candidates, as even Gazdík conceded, Dědek is also dismissing the favourite argument of the head of STAN that the movement's greatest value lies precisely in the political scrutiny and experienced of the mayors, who are traditionally the most popular politicians, an idea also confirmed by the polls.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are now being casually replaced the newly acquired unknown figures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gazdík explained the total break with the KDU, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by claiming the movement does not want to waste its identity on KDU candidates.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, if STAN's identity was only doubted by a few people, the simple identity game has ended with Dědek's arrival on the scene.</seg>
<seg id="12">Gazdík has not only defined himself against Andrey Babiš's ANO party for a long time, in their first joint press conference Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement, to gains 20 percent in the upcoming elections."</seg>
<seg id="13">Let's hope that the movement didn't take it the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dědek is a successful entrepreneur and billionaire, and certainly not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">He often talks about politics just like Babiš, but unlike him he does not his his own political brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">For some time now, STAN has been acting more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek's helping hand seems to be making a shop assistant out of a sought-after bride.</seg>
<seg id="17">STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with the KDU and it is now looking for appropriate people to make a change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Let's hope they click with someone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police dogs trained in helicopter flights in Most</seg>
<seg id="2">Dogs specialised in hunting explosives and search dogs were trained in a helicopter flight over Most lake today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police dogs must not be cowardly or scared of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of police cynologists for the Ústí nad Labem region.</seg>
<seg id="4">Police dog training takes around two years.</seg>
<seg id="5">At Most, previously educated dogs were trained like adults, and those who are not yet trained just passed by.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the standard training, which involves being exposed to specimens of explosives around the lake and looking for a lost figurine, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="8">The dogs had to get to work to as soon as the helicopter landed so that they didn't have problems with it moving.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The helicopter lands, then the dog goes and starts searching immediately," said Tomášek.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dogs that that are upset or unable to start working as the helicopter flies are excluded from training.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They are usually kept in the garden by the handlers, for example," Tomas added.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police have 76 dogs with different specialties in the Ústí region.</seg>
<seg id="13">German shepherds are the dominant breed, but there are also a growing number of Belgian shepherds.</seg>
<seg id="14">The handlers take care of them from the time they are puppies.</seg>
<seg id="15">"They raise them alone, preparing the dogs for the service they will perform for us," Tomášek added.</seg>
<seg id="16">The animals undergo repeated veterinary tests to reveal any possible health issues or disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the dog is healthy and not timid, they take the first test at 20 months.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It takes about two and a half to three years to get a precise aim," Tomášek added.</seg>
<seg id="19">Their time in the police service depends on the dog's health.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most of them remain for around 8 to 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">They generally live with their handlers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Unique brewery brews beer once again.</seg>
<seg id="2">The newly revived brewery is back serving up good beer.</seg>
<seg id="3">The passion and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobeč u Mšena back to life a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The brewery was first commemorated in 1586 and has Renaissance foundations, and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a train depot.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was followed by years of prosperity, when the brewery was especially famous for its dark beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalised in 1984.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that, the buildings served as state property.</seg>
<seg id="8">The demolition work was finished by the owners of the brewery after 1989.</seg>
<seg id="9">The abandoned site was devastated and stripped for building materials.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in 2007 new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouza.</seg>
<seg id="11">They began to repair the buildings with utmost respect for the spirit of the property, down to the smallest detail.</seg>
<seg id="12">They devoted themselves to carefully studying archive documents in an attempt to retain the original materials and building elements.</seg>
<seg id="13">The brewery has the same look as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their work has been rewarded by a declaration from Ministry of Culture proclaiming the brewery to be a cultural monument, and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2015, they festively revived the tradition of beer brewing.</seg>
<seg id="16">If you want to sample a great beer from Lobeč in the scenic countryside around Kokořín, you can visit the pub in the brewery grounds.</seg>
<seg id="17">When brewing the beer, they use water from the protected landscape area of Kokořín, malt from the fields in Lobeč and hops Žatec.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the beer you, you can taste traditional light lager as well as dark beers and specialties.</seg>
<seg id="19">Don't miss out on the tour of the brewery, which is held on Saturdays and Sundays at midday and 13:30.</seg>
<seg id="20">The largest defensive fortress in Czechoslovakia?</seg>
<seg id="21">One of the largest fortresses of its kind in the world?</seg>
<seg id="22">This unique building was supposed to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the ridge of terrain above the village of Babí.</seg>
<seg id="23">Originally, it should have been formed of up to 12 bunkers connected by a cavernous underground area.</seg>
<seg id="24">This was where the headquarters, barracks, ammunition, supplies, power generator, engine room and hospital would have been.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the Munich Agreement put an end to it.</seg>
<seg id="26">In less than a year, it was only possible to build a single massive reinforced concrete bunker and the underground spaces cut off.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg society, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990, you can also see it for yourselves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Seventy five percent of the underground area is already accessible!</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and the underground area, there is also an armed light fortification building, two deployed infantry cabins, trenches and a nature trail by "Opevněné Trutnovsko".</seg>
<seg id="30">Refreshments, a homey alcove and breathtaking views of the region are guaranteed!</seg>
<seg id="31">This unique and amazing Czech building has been on a list alongside such sights as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's harbour near Rome, or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chotěšov Monastery dates back to the beginning of the thirteenth century, and today it mainly consists of a stately four-wing convent building overlooking an exquisite garden.</seg>
<seg id="33">Unfortunately, the list it belongs to is that of unique buildings that are in danger of collapse.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, its devotees do not want to give up, and a lot of events are being held to support the monastery.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of them is the annual dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery, which will take place on Saturday 5 August. Vladimír Mišík amd Ivan Hlas will perform, you can see fencing duels and look at the amazing huge buildings, which are usually inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="36">Above all, you can enjoy the atmosphere of this incredible place.</seg>
<seg id="37">Do you want to look a Neanderthal in the face?</seg>
<seg id="38">The exhibition Vítejte u neandertálců (Welcome to the Land of the Neanderthals) in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno is beckoning visitors to go an unusual excursion into the deepest prehistoric times right back to the Stone Age and the world of our ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="39">You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with all sorts of extreme climate conditions, especially with the alternation of ice and inter-glacial ages.</seg>
<seg id="40">Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful as the predators of their time.</seg>
<seg id="41">You will also learn about their appearance, their anatomy, their technological and hunting skills, as well as their aesthetic sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">You wouldn't call them Neanderthals?</seg>
<seg id="43">Let yourself be convinced in Brno.</seg>

<seg id="1">Identify plants with one click.</seg>
<seg id="2">Students with a herbarium and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free Pl@ntNet app.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whenever someone is interested in which plant they have just encountered, they can find out about it from the application.</seg>
<seg id="4">All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application will recognise the species.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new application is available for both iOS and Android, and was presented on Tuesday by a representative of the CEEV Centra etické a environmentální výchovy (Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education) in Horský Park in Bratislava, as part of the Tajný život města (Secret Life of the City) project.</seg>
<seg id="6">The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who took pictures of plants from their surroundings with their teachers to add to the application database.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newly created French application is free to download from the Tajný život města website.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main goal of French programmers was to encourage as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, thereby increasing the number of plants it can recognise.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Children can go out into the forest with a tablet or mobile phone in their hands," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.</seg>
<seg id="10">Starting from sufficiently high quality photos of a flower, leaf or fruit, the app can find its name in a few seconds, which will then appear under the photo in both Czech and Slovak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The French allowed the application to be translated into Slovak and Czech as part of the Tajný život města project.</seg>
<seg id="12">As such, users are welcome to add plants that do not yet appear in the database once they have created an account.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The French will determine whether it is useful and then add it to the database," said Poláčková.</seg>

<seg id="2">A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="3">GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.</seg>
<seg id="5">McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who will explain the sanctions?</seg>
<seg id="2">Does the political penalty have broadly understandable rules?</seg>
<seg id="3">Donald Trump approved the anti-Russian sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.</seg>
<seg id="5">And the day before that, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it can't go on.</seg>
<seg id="6">His concept of sanctions is slightly wet behind the ears.</seg>
<seg id="7">These things can't be lumped together.</seg>
<seg id="8">Madura's Venezuela has indeed set out on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.</seg>
<seg id="9">China is just not behaving in the way the American president would like.</seg>
<seg id="10">Russia is a whole chapter in itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if anyone wanted to sum it all up so that even a common voter, whether American, European or other, would understand what the system of rules and the sanction policy are based on, it would be almost impossible.</seg>
<seg id="12">With the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only following through on what President Obama put into place. He is simply the one to give them the official stamp.</seg>
<seg id="13">So why such a fuss?</seg>
<seg id="14">Last year, Europe was frightened that if that American elections went in favour of Trump, he would embrace Putin and remove the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was a terrible prospect.</seg>
<seg id="16">In practice, the opposite turned out to be the case, however.</seg>
<seg id="17">Trump has not relaxed the sanctions, but actually tightened them.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Europe is even more scared.</seg>
<seg id="19">German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.</seg>
<seg id="20">Are the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council really kosher?</seg>
<seg id="21">But then, the EU's anti-Russian sanctions aren't kosher either.</seg>
<seg id="22">European Commission chief Juncker is once again complaining that Trump's sanctions are threatening the EU's energy security.</seg>
<seg id="23">Does that mean that only sanctions that are too weak to threaten anyone should be used?</seg>
<seg id="24">The common voter is left in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="25">For three years they heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends solely on the fulfilment of the Minsk agreement concerning Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is understood that it is actually about the EU's energy security.</seg>
<seg id="27">The voter is more in the dark than ever.</seg>
<seg id="28">Russia is penalised for meddling where it shouldn't.</seg>
<seg id="29">China is berated for not meddling enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his own country.</seg>
<seg id="31">All these punishments and considerations have their own rationality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrej Babiš: I will not consider cooperation with Okamura.</seg>
<seg id="2">Andrej Babiš got married, toured the Republic with his visionary book and finalised the electoral programme.</seg>
<seg id="3">Except for the Pardubice Region, all the candidates have already been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">To use his own words, he did not interfere with them in any way.</seg>
<seg id="5">He even agreed to allow "hejtman" (marshall) and Shadow Education Minister Ivo Vondrák lead the Moravian-Silesian region.</seg>
<seg id="6">"But if he is successful, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or hejtman," Babiš stated earlier, confirming his viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="7">You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with the idea that directly elected mayors and chief magistrates should manage municipalities and towns on their own, only using managers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you really mean it?</seg>
<seg id="9">That isn't how it was.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am a supporter of direct democracy. We elect the president directly and I am convinced that it should be the same for mayors and chief magistrates.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't talk about abolishing the representatives in my book, they can stay there comfortably.</seg>
<seg id="12">There question is how many of them there should be.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the presentation of your book "O čem sním, když náhodou spím" (What I Dream About When I Happen to Sleep), I heard you speak about the abolition of representation with my own ears.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't remember that.</seg>
<seg id="15">I spoke about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are nine million inhabitants in New York, which has five districts and 51 representatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prague has 1.2 million citizens and 1171 representatives.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the mayor is making a fuss that little is being built and there are no great projects planned, but she is not competent in that regard.</seg>
<seg id="19">The same applies to the government, which has only been governed by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not saying they did that well.</seg>
<seg id="21">The current prime minister isn't guiding anything, he only moderates the debate.</seg>
<seg id="22">It can't work that way.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is that why you want to push through the majority system?</seg>
<seg id="24">It would be ideal, but it is difficult to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="25">The only change we have in the plan is the one-round election to the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="26">We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the regulations governing the Chamber of Deputies, to prevent unnecessary attendance by members of parliament, who should mainly be working on committees and panels instead of Chamber meetings.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.</seg>
<seg id="28">But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.</seg>
<seg id="29">That you will rule the government like a dictator, control the Chamber of Deputies with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and control the whole country through the grateful mayors and magistrates.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is certainly not the case.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is nothing wrong with debating the number of representatives.</seg>
<seg id="32">The French President Macron announced that he was reducing the legislative board by a third, and there are 57,000 French people per one legislator, whereas here the ratio is 17,000 Czechs to one.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody accused Macron of endangering democracy, however.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if somebody won the majority vote in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms in place to prevent them from making dramatic changes.</seg>
<seg id="35">The temptation is great for those who have the parliamentary majority. Just look at Poland or Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nothing of the sort applies to the ANO movement.</seg>
<seg id="37">We just need a team in government that will work for the people, not for their parties or departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">I do not understand why we have not even been able to agree on increasing wages for teachers and workers in the cultural and social services.</seg>
<seg id="39">Why did they vote for me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who already have 60 thousand?</seg>
<seg id="40">Would you clamp down on that as prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="41">The prime minister has to intervene when the ministers behave wastefully, confusing the government with a travel agency and using the state coffers as a business venture, like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government. Conflicts should be thrown out of it.</seg>
<seg id="43">The material that comes into the cabinet must be ready. There is no room for coalition ruptures, power ballots and deals. Decisions must be made there.</seg>
<seg id="44">How do you expect to have a cohesive team when the ministers mainly act on behalf of the party?</seg>
<seg id="45">The constitutional law is above the parties.</seg>
<seg id="46">When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and turfed Babiš out of the government.</seg>
<seg id="47">Any prime minister can do that.</seg>
<seg id="48">But if they have character and leadership skills then these kinds of gestures are not needed.</seg>
<seg id="49">They measure everyone equally and demand perfect execution from one and all.</seg>
<seg id="50">Do you already know who you would appoint as the Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="51">I'm not thinking about it at all. We will probably will not end up in government. Nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I do not know what I've done that's so terrible.</seg>
<seg id="52">So much skepticism is out of place.</seg>
<seg id="53">The mayors (STAN) enlisted businessman Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you. The KDU-ČSL may beat your winger Jiří Čunek.</seg>
<seg id="54">I don't think so.</seg>
<seg id="55">ČSSD is led by Lubomir Zaoralek, who is not ruling out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus might win out in the ODS, and he also isn't against it.</seg>
<seg id="56">I would leave it to the voters.</seg>
<seg id="57">Deputy Prime Minister and ANO Deputy Chairman Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura's SPD, such as in terms of the economy, for example.</seg>
<seg id="58">So, Okamura supporters are being considered as coalition partners?</seg>
<seg id="59">Mr. Brabec claims that he did not say that.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mr. Okamura has his political history. He stood as Vít Bárta's puppet for the VV, then he earned money for his firm from Úsvit. Some kind of coup took place.</seg>
<seg id="61">He is, of course, a strong personality.</seg>
<seg id="62">But he is browned, somehow.</seg>
<seg id="63">Looking at his plan, it involves the widespread engagement of people in the management of society, i.e. direct democracy, which we can agree on.</seg>
<seg id="64">That's not what I'm asking you about at all.</seg>
<seg id="65">I'm interested in whether it is acceptable for you to work with someone who has xenophobic views, talks about the gallows at demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?</seg>
<seg id="66">We will not consider cooperating with Mr Okamura's party, I can not imagine it.</seg>
<seg id="67">He clearly went into politics for the sake of profit.</seg>
<seg id="68">And what about having the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?</seg>
<seg id="69">I cannot imagine it, but the voters will decide.</seg>
<seg id="70">The winner will negotiate with the person who comes second, but God knows who will be the winner and who number two.</seg>
<seg id="71">Of course, it is important for them to able to agree on a coalition government programme.</seg>
<seg id="72">Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a business.</seg>
<seg id="73">The government simply needs to be led. Prime Minister Sobotka left everything to rot, he never made any decisions.</seg>
<seg id="74">Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP did not work.</seg>
<seg id="75">Anyway, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also why he threw me out.</seg>
<seg id="76">As soon as he did, ČEZ controlled the Czech government.</seg>
<seg id="77">It's unbelievable that the Prime Minister would send a decree written by ČEZ's management stipulating how the Minister of Finance should vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.</seg>
<seg id="78">If you become prime minister, will you change the proportions of personnel in the supervisory board and will you change the top management of ČEZ?</seg>
<seg id="79">Jesus Christ, if I become prime minister then we'll see.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm not there yet.</seg>
<seg id="81">Rumour has it that ČEZ has already been sending you signals.</seg>
<seg id="82">They would like to exchange the hood cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.</seg>
<seg id="83">So maybe after the elections, everything will go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="84">I don't know anything about that.</seg>
<seg id="85">I have no Pokorný or Růžička style lobbyist. I am a separate entity and I do not deal with this at all.</seg>
<seg id="86">So answer directly.</seg>
<seg id="87">If you become the head of government, will you go after the leadership of ČEZ, České televize (Czech Television) or Všeobecné zdravotní pojišťovny, which are the institutions that you criticise?</seg>
<seg id="88">I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.</seg>
<seg id="89">Meanwhile, he has been doing what he wants for years, thanks to kickbacks for traditional political parties.</seg>
<seg id="90">Just look at Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.</seg>
<seg id="91">Even though the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never directed it. It just served as a makeweight, which is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="92">It's a trivial matter, in my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="93">ČEZ should take Dukovany, value it, stick it into a subsidiary, arrange financing, hold a tender for the supplies or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.</seg>
<seg id="94">The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.</seg>
<seg id="95">And Česká televize?</seg>
<seg id="96">Some of its shows have a permanent campaign against me, but I do not have and will not have any authority to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="97">But you could control it.</seg>
<seg id="98">I don't want to control anyone.</seg>
<seg id="99">I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television fees, but they do not really know how these institutions are run.</seg>
<seg id="100">How is it possible that they don't know?</seg>
<seg id="101">The Chamber of Deputies approves a report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the ČT and ČRo (Czech Radio) general managers.</seg>
<seg id="102">Look at how the news handled the Sobotka-Kalousek super-pact, which always worked.</seg>
<seg id="103">This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigation files and Lex Babiš.</seg>
<seg id="104">Sobotka was stupid enough to let himself be pushed around by Kalousek, who made him throw me out of government, which won percentage points for TOP 09 percent, but ČSSD took them away.</seg>
<seg id="105">They are afraid of an interference to their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy posed by Babiš.</seg>
<seg id="106">Nobody is immune.</seg>
<seg id="107">What do you say to the articles describing how, as the first deputy chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a powerhouse by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state-owned companies like Pražský dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Company) and České dráhy (Czech Railways) through the lawyer Květoslav Hlína?</seg>
<seg id="108">We have a long-term dispute over it.</seg>
<seg id="109">I don't like it, and I've reproached him for it several times.</seg>
<seg id="110">Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at considerably lower rates and is reliable.</seg>
<seg id="111">I would not take it so far.</seg>
<seg id="112">I didn't have anyone as Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="113">Unlike the Social Democrats, we have never had any corruption scandals, no Pelts, no Kratochvílová, no Březinas.</seg>
<seg id="114">As soon as there was any hint of clientelism in our party, we threw out threw the people involved out right away.</seg>
<seg id="115">I'm not willing to compromise in that regard.</seg>
<seg id="116">If anything like that were to happen, we would get rid of the relevant people, no matter who they were.</seg>
