<seg id="1">Four members of the Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Postimees, police in Spain have arrested Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world by the name of Slava Kemerovsky.</seg>
<seg id="3">A court had issued for the arrest of Gulevich in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday the court also ordered that three suspects detained in Estonia be held.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the complaint, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organization ranging in age from 27 to 57 and committing primarily drug-related crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the Mijas province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged boss of a criminal organization was detained.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia; according to the gathered evidence, one of them is a leading figure of a criminal organization and two of them are members of a criminal organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The gathered information points to a clear division of roles and functions in the criminal organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">The objective of the criminal organizations activity was to commit to drug crimes, and thereby earn criminal gains,” commented the head of pretrial proceedings in the criminal case, public prosecutor Vahur Verte.</seg>
<seg id="10">“We can’t rule out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase.”</seg>
<seg id="11">These are people who have been in the sphere of interest for law-enforcement agencies in the past and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Verte emphasized that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has played an important part throughout the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">“International cooperation has become the standard for us and this week’s operation shows success of the cooperation,” commented prosecutor Verte.</seg>
<seg id="14">Head of the central criminal police division Ago Leis said that the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted almost a year a half.</seg>
<seg id="15">“The long-running work came to fruition in the first half the week and we made simultaneous arrests of the suspects in these crimes in Estonia and Spain,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Leis added that central criminal police officials assisted in the Spanish arrests.</seg>
<seg id="17">For years now, we have had good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">These arrests send yet another message to criminals that and we will get them from the other end of Europe,” said Leis.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered to this point shows unequivocally that if they remained at liberty, the men named in the complaint could continue committing new crimes, which is why the prosecutor’s office sought their arrests and the court approved it as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">A man arrested in Spain now faces extradition to Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the framework of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash were impounded to secure the confiscation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The pretrial proceedings in the criminal case are being conducted by the criminal police’s organized crime office and headed by the public prosecutor’s office.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2005, Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the middle of last decade, he was considered to rank second in the Estonian criminal world after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Gulevich, who is from Kemerovo, became prominent in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he became involved in extortion in Tallinn.</seg>
<seg id="26">He allegedly put the squeeze on taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels, and demanded monthly pay off from businessmen.</seg>
<seg id="27">Joint international operations, confiscation of criminal gains, and court decisions handed down all confirmed that the fight against organized crime is effective.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example the latest court decisions, the eight accused to be tried separately from the so-called Dikajev crime organization criminal case, from whom 80,000 euros was confiscated, or the court decision with regard to nine persons accusing Igor Aleynikov of establishing in 2006 a crime organization engaged in illegal trade in contraband cigarettes and commission of crimes related to human smuggling in Ida-Viru County and southern Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="29">The amount of criminal gains confiscated in that case was close to 71,500 euros.</seg>
<seg id="30">What has ensured success in these criminal cases is the fact that police offices exchange information each day with their colleagues and prosecutors exchange evidence, and if necessary they conduct operations jointly in any other European Union member state.</seg>

<seg id="1">Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hepatitis: what should everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?</seg>
<seg id="2">Hepatitis – inflammation of the liver – may be caused by any of five hepatitis viruses – A, B, C, D and E.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of liver tissue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chronic hepatitis B and C have a malignant profile, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Health Board epidemiology advisor Kuulo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation – fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowness of skin and mucous membranes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latter condition is the origin of the popular name for hepatitis in Estonian, kollatõbi or yellow disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">In children, hepatitis can progress without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="8">The various types of hepatitis can be diagnosed only through laboratory testing.</seg>
<seg id="9">But hepatitis can change over to the chronic form of the disease and have a course of decades without symptoms, which means that people may not necessarily be aware that they have a dangerous disease that damages the liver.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kutsar notes the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in detail.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us through eating of contaminated food or drinking of water, during sex, contact between hands and faeces from infected people and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, through contact with the mouth, and drug use.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among the risk group for hepatitis A infection are family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver diseases, sex partners of infected people, men who have sex with men, drug abusers, and travellers to countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A.</seg>
<seg id="13">Infection can be prevented through vaccination. Above all, vaccination is recommended for people who travel often and people in the hepatitis A risk group.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, following everyday good hygiene is important: washing or disinfecting hands, washing all fruits and vegetable before use as food.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood from a sick person, drug injecting, tattooing, piercing, use of everyday items contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shaving accessories), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from mother infected with hepatitis to a foetus/newborn.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among the risk group for hepatitis B infection are drug abusers, sex partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, infected mother to a newborn, family members and caregivers of the sick, healthcare, rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prevention of hepatitis B is possible by vaccinating people; vaccination is also recommended for people in risk groups, along with people with chronic liver diseases, and people with HIV, STDs and diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Other ways of preventing hepatitis B are: refraining from sharing personal hygiene and manicure accessories, other objects with blades and syringes and needles, refraining from tattooing and piercing, and using a condom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Estonia, hepatitis B vaccinations are a part of the state immunization plan and are free for children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hepatitis C viruses spread from exposure to the blood of a sick person, drug injecting, tattooing, piercing, use of everyday items contaminated with blood, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis and from a mother sick with hepatitis to foetus/newborn.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among the risk group for hepatitis B infection are injecting drug abusers, sex partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, an infected mother to newborn, family members and caregivers of the sick, healthcare, rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, people infected with HIV, and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="22">Preventive measures for hepatitis C are: refraining from sharing personal hygiene and manicure accessories, other objects with blades and syringes and needles, refraining from tattooing and piercing; and using a condom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus hepatitis D is co-morbid with hepatitis B or a superinfection among those with chronic hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hepatitis D viruses spread through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, syringes and needles contaminated with blood and other bodily fluids, sexual transmission and, rarely, from infected mother to foetus.</seg>
<seg id="27">The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic carriers of hepatitis D virus and people who lack immunity to hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="28">An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D infection.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hepatitis E viruses are spread through the faecal-oral route involving drinking water and food, including undercooked meat, consumption of fish and shellfish, through donor blood, shared syringes and from infected mother to foetus.</seg>
<seg id="30">Travellers may become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high incidence.</seg>
<seg id="31">Preventive measures for hepatitis E are following good hygiene: washing or disinfecting hands after using the washroom, before food preparation and eating, and after providing care to patients.</seg>
<seg id="32">Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating undercooked meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from use of drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Despite the title, Anne-Marie O’Connor’s Lady in Gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, delves a good bit deeper into the late 19th and early 20th century history of Vienna cultural life.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it delves even deeper into history.</seg>
<seg id="3">The awe-inspiring amount of information could have benefited from less sparing cuts, and a narrower focus would have allowed the portrait promised in the heading to shine more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Right now, it’s as if two books were inside one cover: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted in his painting The Lady in Gold and a much larger and more sweeping history book of distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation and its aftereffects in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first third of the book leads us into the vibrant Viennese cultural life – and anyone who has been to the Austrian capital will have little trouble imagining what life was like more than a hundred years ago around the Ringstrasse or how all heads turned in the Central Café when Klimt entered.</seg>
<seg id="6">The concentration of cultural figures in one of Europe’s wealthiest cities was high and upon seeing a familiar name in the book, you feel that you yourself are a tiny bit more cultured.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time, the fact that, say, Sigmund Freud lived and worked in a city teeming with untreated syphilis raged and having Europe’s highest suicide rate doesn’t lend much to the story’s development.</seg>
<seg id="8">And yet perhaps – every brushstroke of a few sentences adds tone colour to the early 20th century cultural life in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union</seg>
<seg id="10">In the closing decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the biggest Jewish community in Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the turn of the century, one in ten Vienna residents was Jewish.</seg>
<seg id="12">Adele’s parents as well were newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married a Czech sugar magnate twice her age, Ferdinand Bloch, and posed for the Klimt’s famous paintings, her father’s bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Adele was not drawn by the whole glamorous life she was a part of.</seg>
<seg id="14">If we look at Lady in Gold, it’s hard to believe that toward the end of her life, this grand dame was infected by socialism and dreamed of a trip to the USSR.</seg>
<seg id="15">By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the latter was the hottest painter in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="16">Klimt’s commission at the time was 4,000 crowns, a quarter of the price of a good country house.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that in the case of some portraits, the master was suspected of having an affair with the model didn’t deter the magnate.</seg>
<seg id="18">As to Adele, the only thing known for certain is that the close bond that developed between the model and the artist during the painting process persisted until the end of their lives.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anne-Marie O’Connor – Lady in Gold.</seg>
<seg id="20">The extraordinary story behind the Gustav Klimt masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.</seg>
<seg id="21">Immediately before starting work with Adele, Klimt had been to the San Vitale Basilica in Ravenna and scholars believe that it was the brilliant mosaics of the empress Theodora he saw there that gave the artist the idea of creating a golden portrait of Adele in the form of a painted mosaic.</seg>
<seg id="22">Klimt presented his Lady in Gold in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (1907-1908) another golden painting called Kiss was conceived.</seg>
<seg id="23">The similarity between the two women was not overlooked by art historians of course.</seg>
<seg id="24">How is Hitler tied in to the story?</seg>
<seg id="25">“I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I am in his debt that I should make his handiwork accessible to the public;” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of Belvedere Museum a few years after the demise of the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) and expressed the wish that their family’s Klimt collection pass to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="26">Six years before his death, Klimt had painted another portrait of Adele.</seg>
<seg id="27">In her testament as well (Adele died in February 1925), she asked that her husband leave her two portraits and four Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">She left her jewellery to her nieces Maria and Luise.</seg>
<seg id="29">A year after Klimt finished work on the “Austrian Mona Lisa,” the 17-year-odl Adolf Hitler had striven for admission to the Vienna fine Art Academy, but failed his drawing examination.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to Jewish professors not admitting him to the academy, in fact none of his examiners was a Jew.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, the function of the Austrian Gallery mentioned in Maria’s will had changed markedly by 1939 – it was no important to find works from among Vienna’s richly endowed Jewish art collections that were to the liking of the Nazi Party.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some of the works in Adele’s home were suitable for Hitler’s personal art treasury, but not those of Klimt.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sixty years after the Nazi art heists, a 10-year-long court dispute between the Austrian government and the successors of the Bloch-Bauers began.</seg>
<seg id="34">Let it be noted here that while Kiss can be seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, a trip to New York’s Neue Galerie is required to see the depiction of Adele Bloch-Bauer in Lady in Gold.</seg>
<seg id="35">And before a trip to Vienna, read the abovementioned book.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if you don’t plan to go see works by Klimt, after closing the book, at least my own emotions revolved around Nazi and Jewish themes more than the painting sold for 135 million dollars and the model Adele Bloch-Bauer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Thus it is not so much a portrait but more of a story of the fate of a family – and a very moving story at that.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bauer family tree reproduced at the start of the book made it significantly easier to orientate with regard to the events.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen their teeth</seg>
<seg id="2">Vacation season is here, which means relaxation for US President Donald Trump as well.</seg>
<seg id="3">As Trump is one of the presidents who has taken the most days of holiday, critics are already sharpening their teeth.</seg>
<seg id="4">USA Today and CNN report that the president plans to spend his 17-day holiday at the golf club named after him in Bedminster, which is located in New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the president’s holiday started yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been speaking out on the topic of the vacation for about a week now.</seg>
<seg id="6">They criticize Trump for going on vacation too often.</seg>
<seg id="7">Namely, the president is in the habit of spending the weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the way, Trump in his 196 days in office has not taken the most vacation time of any president.</seg>
<seg id="9">For instance, George W. Bush had already taken 67 days of holiday y that time, and Barack Obama half as much as Trump – only 21 days.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Trump does tend to forget things quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just a few days after becoming president, Trump told 60 Minutes that he would not have time for long vacations during his term in office, as there is so much to be done.</seg>
<seg id="12">Three years ago, he also expressed displeasure over Barack Obama’s vacations.</seg>
<seg id="13">The now president wrote on Twitter back then: While Obama vacations, golfs, attends parties & jazz concerts, ISIS is chopping heads off of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="14">White House officials say a 17-day golf club visit isn’t really relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is being official called a working vacation instead, during which Trump will have no time to read or other favourite activities.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, there was said to be another reason for the working vacation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Namely, the air conditioning ion the West Wing of the White House is being replaced and thus all staff had to move out.</seg>
<seg id="18">The West Wing is where the Oval Office and other working areas for the present are located.</seg>
<seg id="19">“I don’t think any of you would like to be in the West Wing in an August D.C. summer day when it’s over 100 degrees with no air conditioning,” said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during his vacation.</seg>
<seg id="20">As to where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, the video gives some idea.</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a great showcase for this course."</seg>
<seg id="9">Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's a wonderful place to play golf in.</seg>
<seg id="14">The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."</seg>
<seg id="16">Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."</seg>
<seg id="127">Local people want more foreign governments to take note.</seg>
<seg id="128">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="129">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.</seg>
<seg id="131">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="132">Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="133">"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="134">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.</seg>
<seg id="135">Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="136">"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.</seg>
<seg id="137">"What else could we do?"</seg>

<seg id="2">A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Watch: these phones should become the autumn’s top sellers</seg>
<seg id="2">The spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because that I when telephone manufacturers unveil their new top of the line models.</seg>
<seg id="3">The spring saw the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium go on sale, and new hit smartphones are awaited on shelves in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tele2’s marketing and sale director Kristjan Seema says today’s flagships are characterized by an innovative design, iris scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Samsung Galaxy S8 caused ripples of excitement in the tech world, and it is now among the top sellers in Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="6">The autumn holds the promise of even faster rapid charging, longer battery life, higher quality cameras and better waterproofness and dust resistance.</seg>
<seg id="7">He added that rumour allowed him to predict the four top models that will probably conquer the sales rankings this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">These four top models of smartphones will go on sale only this autumn.</seg>
<seg id="9">The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach stores already in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rumours are rife about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whereas the iPhone 7 didn’t bring anything significantly different to the iPhone 6s, it’s expected that on the occasion of Apple’s 10th birthday the new model will be completely distinct from previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four colours have been mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chrome.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the elements of the new design is doubtless the screen, which takes up the entire front panel of the phone, the home button has been scrapped and the fingerprint reader has been built into the screen.</seg>
<seg id="14">Apple’s design chief JonyIve requires that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Besides iris scanner, wireless charging and an even better camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is certainly one of the year’s most eagerly awaited smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pre-ordering of the brand-new Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many rumours have been leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.</seg>
<seg id="20">It’s been said that more attention has been given to business users and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.</seg>
<seg id="21">The phone should have two cameras, of which one is wide-angle and the other one is a telephoto lens with narrower angle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Currently no one knows what the two rear-facing cameras are capable of, but in any case, it is Samsung’s first attempt, which is sure to be comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are looking forward to 23 August with bated breath.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Nokia has launched three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, their flagship is still missing – the Nokia 8, which will be released 16 August.</seg>
<seg id="25">We expect an edge-to-edge 5.3-inch screen, a blazingly fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a longer battery life.</seg>
<seg id="26">A talking point for the Nokia is also the aluminium body and noteworthy IP68 waterproofness and dustproofness rating.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly to the Samsung, the new model of the Nokia has two rear-facing cameras, with Zeiss optics.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sony’s stable flagship has been the XZ Premium to this point, but the manufacturer has said that in the near future at least two smartphones with even more innovative functions will be added.</seg>
<seg id="29">We are awaiting a smartphone that while it is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, it will have a camera that is as good or better.</seg>
<seg id="30">It has been speculated that the screen on the new Sony model will be at least 6-inch.</seg>
<seg id="31">We’ll get to see quite soon what the reality will be, as traditionally, Sony has released its autumn flagship at the IFA international tech fair, which runs from 1-6 September this year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="3">On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.</seg>
<seg id="4">The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."</seg>
<seg id="5">Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.</seg>
<seg id="6">Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Although many complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend Festival disturbs their sleep and that the whole city is full of drunken revellers, there are also many who have nothing negative to say about the festival on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="2">I’m actually positively surprised that the festivalgoers were so well behaved in the shop!</seg>
<seg id="3">I didn’t see anyone in a stupor or being uncivil.</seg>
<seg id="4">I even saw niceness,” says Laine, from Pärnu.</seg>
<seg id="5">“It’s so great that people come, have a stay and enjoy Pärnu, which goes into hibernation in winter,” she adds cheerfully.</seg>
<seg id="6">The pounding music heard from the beach doesn’t keep Laine up at night.</seg>
<seg id="7">Living in the city centre, she heard music coming from the beach, but now the walls of her home are out of range of the music.</seg>
<seg id="8">“But I hope I do hear it,” she says cheerfully.</seg>
<seg id="9">Agnes, who also spoke with Õhtuleht, said that the summer festival was a good rather than a bad thing for Pärnu – it boosts local merchants’ turnover, after all.</seg>
<seg id="10">She is also pleased that so many foreigners came to the summer capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">The festivalgoers’ revelry doesn’t faze the woman.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even though I don’t go to the beach to sunbathe anymore, it’s great that the beach has come to life.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it’s great that people are moving about and it’s been that way for three times now,” she says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first time it was a little worse, I think.</seg>
<seg id="15">“That time there were complaints perhaps,” she says, thinking.</seg>
<seg id="16">But partying on the beach, she says, is a common thing for residents of the “summer capital”.</seg>
<seg id="17">“That Weekend is a great promo for our little city,” says Harri, who is lolling in the park.</seg>
<seg id="18">The revelry and carousing hasn’t turned his life upside down.</seg>
<seg id="19">But why?</seg>
<seg id="20">We all have to stick together.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have to think about how the international relations could be better.</seg>
<seg id="22">Loud music doesn’t get his spirits down.</seg>
<seg id="23">It doesn’t bother me, even though I live close by.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Good folks are able to stick together and there’s no trouble,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The visitors to Pärnu are well behaved, he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">“They hit the bottle pretty hard, of course, but kids will be kids and Lord, let it be, be decent and we’ll get by,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="27">The people living in the beach area go somewhere else for that time, to visit friends or family.</seg>
<seg id="28">“But in general, the festival life has a positive influence – people like that kind of revelry,” says Tiina, who was out walking with her children in Pärnu.</seg>
<seg id="29">The festival music doesn’t bother her family’s slumber, even though last year it was heard a bit further than this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last summer, the stage faced the other way. Then we heard more.</seg>
<seg id="31">We actually live outside the city, and it can be heard quite well way over by the Pärnu River,” she says.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.</seg>

<seg id="2">German pigs and cattle may have a field day as heavy rain is jeopardizing the harvest in the EU’ second largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.</seg>
<seg id="3">This year it may happen that the rains that have lasted weeks before the harvest may mean that grain intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.</seg>
<seg id="4">“The quality of wheat is far worse than it was last year and worse than in 2015,” said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Chilla.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year, as much as 40 per cent of wheat may end up as feed, which is double the usual level, Agravis forecasted.</seg>
<seg id="6">German farmers, and their ilk throughout Europe, have experienced all sorts of weather this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">First, the winter was too dry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then came a cold spring, which was supplanted by a cold snap in June.</seg>
<seg id="9">In July, showers hit Germany, and have continued in August, too.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many eyes are trained on northern Germany where rain is hampering the harvest.</seg>
<seg id="11">To this point, only five per cent of the wheat has been harvested.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown</seg>
<seg id="2">Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.</seg>
<seg id="5">Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?</seg>
<seg id="6">Best of luck to you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="1">What corners of the world do people move to Estonia from?</seg>
<seg id="2">Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended residence permits for a record more than 13,000 third-country nationals who have mainly travelled to Estonia to pursue work, studies or for family.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, last year, it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,702 foreigners, but the year before last the number was 4,928.</seg>
<seg id="4">Government offices can’t say how many immigrants will end up staying in Estonia permanently, but the Ministry of the Interior is working on such an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whereas ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia, this number has been approaching 2,000 in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="6">The number of residence permit applicants grew in leaps and bounds during the Ukrainian crisis – in 2014, 1,087 received a temporary residence permit, 675 in the year before that.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the fastest in Estonia – last year, 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been big and due to the complicated situation in the country, it’s natural that people look for work and study possibilities in a country where there is a community and many have family members already ahead of them,” said Ministry of the Interior press representative Kristin Rammus.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year and the year before last, the number of Ukrainians who have received a temporary residence permit was even greater than the number of Russian citizens, even though more the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter during the last ten years.</seg>
<seg id="10">While Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens come for family migration.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Considering the historical Russian community here, this they have likely the closest family ties to people living in Russia,” said Academy of Security Sciences migration researcher Helina Maasing.</seg>
<seg id="12">“If we look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have settled, Ida-Viru County comes right after Harju County,” she added and noted that 40 per cent of them are married to EU citizens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.</seg>
<seg id="14">The number of Russians who wished to extend residence permits decreased at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="15">“The jump is because instead of extending residence permits, they have applied for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia,” said interior ministry press representative Rammus, who said interest among Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has tended to be stable for years.</seg>
<seg id="16">As of last year, foreign nationals who have lived here at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to encourage people who have adjusted to the local situation to stay here.</seg>
<seg id="18">The residence permit for long-term residents requires five years, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The new residence permit has probably resulted in decreased extensions of old residence permits.</seg>
<seg id="20">For instance, last year such a residence permit was issued to 146 Ukrainians who had lived worked here for at least three years.</seg>
<seg id="21">Now Ukrainians can change their employer and the Estonian state no longer keeps close tabs on whether the salary criterion is fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="22">This residence permit became popular at one stroke – applicants last year also included grey passport holders (1,029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).</seg>
<seg id="23">In total, 1,968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of settling in Estonia, also including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the first half-year of this year, the total number of such applicants has already reached 1,269.</seg>
<seg id="25">In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become the country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit.</seg>
<seg id="26">Whereas in 2007, three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, last year the number was 200.</seg>
<seg id="27">People come from Nigeria to study at local universities.</seg>
<seg id="28">Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mainly due to study migration.</seg>
<seg id="30">In their case as well, the rule is that where a community has taken shape ahead of them, others arrive more easily,” added Rammus.</seg>
<seg id="31">In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, North Korea, and just as many from Laos and Madagascar.</seg>
<seg id="32">Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.</seg>
<seg id="33">In a given year, about 6,000 third-country citizens receive a residence permit, which is about 0.46 per cent of the population.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if we include EU citizens in the total, migration will be around 1 per cent,” said Maasing, noting that the numbers are actually small.</seg>
<seg id="35">In total, according to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people immigrated to Estonia, and 13,792 emigrated.</seg>
<seg id="36">That means that immigration outstripped emigration for a second year.</seg>
<seg id="37">Most immigrants and emigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the ones leaving.</seg>
<seg id="38">For that reason, the migration balance for Estonian citizens was negative 2,000 last year.</seg>
<seg id="39">Estonians migrate between Finland and Estonia the most.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mammu Couture princess fashion entices with frills, embroidery and tulle.</seg>
<seg id="2">Nevertheless, history is a bottomless well of ideas for Maria Tammeoru – old paintings and costumes: “I can sit in some museum for hours lost in reverie, just admiring old-fashioned sleeves and collars.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you do something with passion, you study and learn from it every day.</seg>
<seg id="4">It’s the joy of discovery!</seg>
<seg id="5">Mammu Couture’s glamorous world may seem out of touch for some, but the designer doesn’t think so.</seg>
<seg id="6">You yourself decide how much flair there is in your life!</seg>
<seg id="7">I have a girlfriend whose entire sauna is full of my haute couture dresses.</seg>
<seg id="8">It isn’t her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t walk the red carpet every day; she wants to wear the prettiest dresses, and does wear them!</seg>
<seg id="9">You can live your own life so it’s special!</seg>
<seg id="10">The fashion artist doesn’t acknowledge a rift between glamorous events and the grey everyday.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was this idea that got the plan rolling to take haute couture to the countryside in Estonia, amidst fields and forests, people that fashion doesn’t usually reach.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Mammu collection was showcased in Võru, in Jõhvi and along the fashion street in Pärnu, where a regal column of 45 models filled the entire street.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Tallinn, often people strike a pose, give a distinguished nod, but elsewhere there’s more emotions – cries of bravo!, standing ovations, people wanting to thank you physically.</seg>
<seg id="14">A large part of the audience just came out of curiosity, but they’re now fans of Mammu Couture.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you exceed people’s expectations, they’re thrilled!</seg>
<seg id="16">And I like the feeling that I’m on a summer tour with my fashion creations.</seg>
<seg id="17">We had a 50-metre long red carpet in Pärnu, a whole street of beautiful dresses, it seemed they would never end!</seg>
<seg id="18">Maria doesn’t also accept the fashion custom that fashion designs have to be presented by a twiggy supermodel; she is happy to bring ordinary women on to the catwalk.</seg>
<seg id="19">I often invite my own clients to take the stage – they’ve always accepted the offer gladly.</seg>
<seg id="20">It’s such a cool experience, you can shine on stage in an incredibly beautiful dress!</seg>
<seg id="21">I feel so sorry that I haven’t ever seen my own shows, I’m always behind the stage, perfectionistically giving things a final polish.</seg>
<seg id="22">I wouldn’t have the nerve to just watch calmly from the audience.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn’t want to solely fill a representative role – she wants to have her fingers in everything.</seg>
<seg id="24">I have a sewing machine in my studio, I execute most of the collection myself.</seg>
<seg id="25">I like the whole process, where you’re playing with the details, making discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="26">I’m never far from my work and I’m not afraid of work.</seg>
<seg id="27">It isn’t restricted to design, stylistics, logistics, managing, organizing – a temperamental woman’s day has to have room for all of it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Fanatics do rack up an incredible amount of work hours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I can’t even say when my workday ends, for me it’s just a day full of fun!</seg>
<seg id="30">I’ve been very fortunate – it’s like a unbroken circle of happiness: I make something beautiful, people get something beautiful, and then compliments on top of that.</seg>
<seg id="31">It’s been said a number of times that there’s magic in my dresses – they make me feel like a princess.</seg>
<seg id="32">The lavish tulle frills that made Maria’s talent an overnight sensation, have remained the signature of Mammu Couture right up to the present.</seg>

<seg id="1">Martin Müürsepp on U18 boys: the Estonian tournament’s weapon now was turned against us</seg>
<seg id="2">Too bad, the fairy-tale ended.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first thing I noticed is that we didn’t get rebounds.</seg>
<seg id="4">And when there’s such a big difference in rebounding, there’s nothing to be done,” commented BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp, the only Estonian to have played in the NBA, in commenting on the Estonian U18 boys’ team’s 75-61 loss to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The opponents grabbed 28 offensive rebounds and got more scoring chances because of that.</seg>
<seg id="6">We weren’t ready for their aggressive defence or offence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn’t set up the defence.</seg>
<seg id="8">They were able to get a hand in the way everywhere while on defence, and our playmaking was hampered.</seg>
<seg id="9">That knocked us off our feet.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our opponents had done their homework better.</seg>
<seg id="11">Müürsepp said Estonia should have committed more fouls to nip the opponents’ momentum in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the last quarter as well, we had zero fouls but the opponents had already scored a number of quick baskets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Athleticism and hustle, which were our weapon in the tournament, now was turned against us.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today we were powerless against their aggressive play.</seg>
<seg id="15">Müürsepp said he was satisfied with his charge on the Kalev squad, Matthias Tass.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the tournament, generally good words can be said about the whole team, to this point we were a united strike force.</seg>
<seg id="17">It’s too bad that we hadn’t met such aggressive opponents before</seg>
<seg id="18">Tass has been self-confident the whole time and he had a strong outing today as well, but it seemed he was tired – he had been carrying a pretty heavy burden.</seg>
<seg id="19">But he made a couple nice moves that I’ve seen before in practices,” added the coach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Awful numbers: girls’ basketball team held to under 10 points in three quarters at European championship tournament…</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only the young men’s European championship division B basketball tournament is underway in U18 age class in Tallinn; the young women started yesterday in Dublin.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Estonia’s game with Poland tended unfortunately to be in the anti-record category.</seg>
<seg id="4">Estonia lost 65-25, but the score after three quarters was 49-9, meaning that only in the last ten minutes did the opponents take their foot off the gas and scoring in that period was even, 16-16.</seg>
<seg id="5">Estonia scored 4 points in the first and second quarter and 1 point in the third…</seg>
<seg id="6">The Estonians made two of the first four field goal attempts in two minutes, from there on, they missed 25 in a row, then a three-pointer went in, and then another 21 missed attempts…</seg>
<seg id="7">In other words, they made one out of 47 shot attempts in nearly half an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.</seg>
<seg id="9">The number of turnovers during that time was normal, 12.</seg>
<seg id="10">By the end of the game, Poland was shooting 33% from the field; and Estonia, 13% (9 out of 68).</seg>
<seg id="11">Estonia started the tournament with two losses, having to concede to Portugal, 83-56, on the opening day.</seg>

<seg id="2">Today, NATO Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 arrived in Tallinn for a weekend port call to replenish ships’ stores and prepare for an upcoming exercise.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the course of the visit, the ships will prepare for returning to sea and will give the crew members a chance for a couple days of shore leave.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be prepared for future operations to search for historical ordnance.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Estonians’ participation in the NATO unit and the interoperability exercise in local waters typifies our integrated allied forces,” said Capt. Maj. Arto Reinmaa, the operations and planning division commander in the capacity of commander of the naval fleet.</seg>
<seg id="6">Starting 29 June, NATO Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 is headed by Latvian naval Capt. Lt. Gvido Laudups, who took over the functions of group commander from Estonian naval officer Capt. Lt. Johan Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony held in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Latvian naval auxiliary LVNS Virsaitis has been made the flagship of the group, and the group’s command staff also is based on board.</seg>
<seg id="8">This half-year, the Estonian minesweeper Sakala is also part of the international unit.</seg>
<seg id="9">As one of four groups of ships subordinate to the NATO naval command, Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 is a response unit that is among the primary rapid responders, which the alliance can deploy in various places around the world in five days.</seg>

<seg id="1">From 4-13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Convent again turn into the venue for the Birgitta Festival started 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas.</seg>
<seg id="2">This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joost, 36.</seg>
<seg id="3">Risto Joost: Listeners will hear opera classics La Traviata and Tosca, see ballet performances from Bolero to “Karlsson” and there’s even an in-production in the programme, which this time will be a performance of Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratorio The Seasons by the same international creative team that brought another Haydn masterpiece to the stage at Pirita in 2015, The Creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is much more at Birgitta Festival than just concerts and theatre performances.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is bigger than any other musical theatre in its conventional form.</seg>
<seg id="6">It’s a festival whose magic gets a hold on you and doesn’t quite ever let go.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the experience that listeners get in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human spirits resonate and touches human senses in a way that can’t be described.</seg>
<seg id="8">Risto, it is your first year as artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="9">Don’t maestro Eri Klas’s shoes seem a bit big for you?</seg>
<seg id="10">Naturally but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, that has helped me greatly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He guided me throughout my time as a student and also supported ma at the start of my conducting career.</seg>
<seg id="12">Maybe thanks to this it is easier for me to continue his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and naturally it all spreads to me as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was Eri Klas’s big heart that gave me energy to go ahead with Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.</seg>
<seg id="16">And here I am now, and I’ll manage!</seg>
<seg id="17">What might excite the public at this year’s festival, anything special being offered?</seg>
<seg id="18">We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise the first ballet based on an Astrid Lindgren story will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It’s “Karlsson Flies”.</seg>
<seg id="20">And a curious twist is that the ballet is by Latvian composer Juris Karlsons and it was his idea to write it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Karlsson-on-the-Roof character had been dwelling in his soul since he was a child, it appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">Risto, how do you find the energy for everything?</seg>
<seg id="23">Thanks to my supportive partner, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="24">This kind of work needs a support system and much love and fortunately I have that in spades.</seg>
<seg id="25">And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend so much on other people, as on my own self – on how I set out to face each new day.</seg>
<seg id="26">And this sort of consciously maintaining one’s tone, staying positive and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror in the morning significantly increased my happiness quotient.</seg>
<seg id="27">Especially this week, with the most important rehearsals, I have been avidly practising it and works.</seg>
<seg id="28">Smiling at yourself stimulates the brain and improves tone.</seg>
<seg id="29">It isn’t just empty words.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that people don’t know half of the things about their body that the universe offers them, but I suppose everyone has to discover it little by little.</seg>
<seg id="31">The big moment is about to come.</seg>
<seg id="32">Do you have any ritual before the ascend the conductor’s podium?</seg>
<seg id="33">Sure – you have to change into more comfortable clothing.</seg>
<seg id="34">It’s a little moment for myself.</seg>
<seg id="35">But in general, I don’t have a chance to rest up or take a short nap before a big performance.</seg>
<seg id="36">Actually I like interacting actively with people, even before ascending the podium.</seg>
<seg id="37">But everybody come out to the Birgitta Festival, there’s plenty to discover here even for people who aren’t big opera and ballet fans!</seg>
<seg id="38">Watch the enjoyable video with Risto Joost!</seg>

<seg id="1">New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."</seg>
<seg id="5">The rally erupted in cheers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's worth about $1.59 billion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal</seg>
<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">The electric car revolution is transforming demand for metals</seg>
<seg id="2">Who are the winners and losers?</seg>
<seg id="3">If it wasn’t enough that the electric car revolution is transforming everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it is also creating new winners and losers on the metals market.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although mining giants such as Glencore can say that they are winning in one area and losing in another, this is of no use to smaller mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Glencore currently makes money on coal and oil, but in future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the electric car age.</seg>
<seg id="6">This year, decision by the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have raised the stakes with regard to the spread of electric cars, as they promise to prohibit the sale of fossil fuel powered cars in the decades ahead.</seg>
<seg id="7">That’s why Volvo has already announced that they plan to phase out internal combustion engines and Tesla will be introducing a cheaper Model 3 electric car.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in the next two decades more electric cars will be sold than cars that use petroleum-derived fuels.</seg>
<seg id="9">“It will change everything with regard to some metals,” Capital Economics commodities analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have already seen a great impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium whose demand has grown for years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars,” said Glencore.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is even more copper in charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas believes it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">The increase in demand for electric car batteries will mean additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.</seg>
<seg id="14">Glencore will derive income from the growing electric car trend from the rise in copper prices, and the fact that it is the world’s biggest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group has forecasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">This brokerage believes that Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals will be other winners from the ascendancy of electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="16">The market is already responding to the changing trend.</seg>
<seg id="17">This year, cobalt has already risen 70 per cent in price on the London Metal Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year’s price rise was 37 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Copper, too, is up 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="20">Glencore shares rose 20 per cent in London, outstripping rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in its increase.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the loser’s side, there companies engaged in lead, like Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.</seg>
<seg id="22">The main end use of lead is in batteries that provide current to the starters of petrol and diesel cars.</seg>
<seg id="23">Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.</seg>
<seg id="24">“This is a serious risk to lead demand, unless some other purpose is found for it, that would exceed the decline in demand,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s head of metal market analysis, Michael Widmer.</seg>
<seg id="25">The effect of the unfurling trend isn’t showing up yet in lead prices.</seg>
<seg id="26">Lead has increased in price by 17 per cent this year, being the biggest gainer among industrial metals in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">Investors see problems for the metal only in the distant future.</seg>
<seg id="28">“I’m not sure that it will be so bad for lead, because cheap oil will keep conventional cars competition,” said Herwig Schmidt, the sales director of the metal brokerage Triland Metals.</seg>
<seg id="29">If lead demand falls, it will happen slowly.</seg>
<seg id="30">Perhaps it will happen in about ten years’ time.</seg>
<seg id="31">For now, the stricter emissions standards mean growing demand for hybrid cars that depend on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine starts, in the estimation of an international lead and zinc research organization.</seg>
<seg id="32">Light metals such as aluminium will replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further on less electricity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The additional 1.6 million tonne aluminium demand in the years 2013-2016 can already be attributed to this.</seg>
<seg id="34">This makes up 2.7 per cent of the total world aluminium production.</seg>
<seg id="35">The trend will likely deepen, says Widmer.</seg>
<seg id="36">Aluminium has increased in price by 13 per cent this year, as growing demand from auto makers has led to a market deficit.</seg>
<seg id="37">Steel producers not asleep.</seg>
<seg id="38">AK Steel Holding is partnered with General Motors for using nanotechnology for manufacturing incredibly light car bodies.</seg>
<seg id="39">ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter steel alloys to compete with aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="40">“Ultrastrong steel should be the answer to this development,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some success can be seen in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="42">The end of the oil era can lead to tribulations for platinum as well.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, about half of this precious metal was used for catalytic converters in diesel cars,” said metal refiner Johnson Matthey.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Many commodities in high demand such as oil and platinum may not necessarily have high demand in future,” said commodities analyst for Natixis, Bernard Dahdah.</seg>
<seg id="45">This doesn’t mean that commodities as a whole will become less important but their importance will change over the next 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Platinum producers believe there will be continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.</seg>
<seg id="47">Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that in 2025, sales of hybrid cars will still exceed that of fully electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="48">Platinum producers’ big hope in the 10-year perspective rests with the hydrogen element based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai, which depend on platinum for producing electricity from hydrogen.</seg>
<seg id="49">To this point, the technology has not proved its worth commercially.</seg>
<seg id="50">“Diesel appears to be the clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Brunet from Exane BNP Paribas.</seg>
<seg id="51">In July, German auto makers experience d a big setback as a Stuttgart court forbade the use of diesel in the home city of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1">Fifty years ago today: a storm of hurricane magnitude in Estonia, which tore roofs and windows off houses</seg>
<seg id="2">The hurricane, called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage above all in Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County.</seg>
<seg id="3">The wind speed in northwestern Estonia on those days was over 30 m/s.</seg>
<seg id="4">My husband ran through the garden from one arching tree to the next trying to support them by hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was all dark with a rumbling sound, like the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Roofs were already flying off the houses yonder, recalled an older woman, Linda Kurova of Haapsalu, in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="7">Linda’s husband watched the orchard she’d planted blow down.</seg>
<seg id="8">But why try to support trees with your arms, what power do you have against such a storm?</seg>
<seg id="9">The storm surge came up to the window, water sprayed in through the windows,” said Ms. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu back then.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like most Haapsalu residents, only the following morning did Linda see how the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station platform had flown 20-30 metres away</seg>
<seg id="11">Locals said trees behind Paralepa were bowed over so that they were touching the ground, some were completely felled, some snapped in two.</seg>
<seg id="12">Everything looked really horrible, the storm had ravaged the beautiful old trees much as a war might have done.</seg>
<seg id="13">Compared to Lääne County, Lääne-Viru County did not sustain particularly severe damage compared to the August storm of 1967, but the losses were high there, too, Virumaa Teataja reported in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="14">Haapsalu castle park and Padise park were wiped off the face of the earth, but parks in our area also sustained heavy damage.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured at as much as 35 metres per second – in other words, about 130 kilometres per hour.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Merivälja part of Tallinn, on 6 August, one tiny slip of a girl was said to have shouted: “Mother, mother!</seg>
<seg id="17">The chickens are in the air and can’t come down anymore,” Virumaa Teataja reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was so badly damaged by the storm that it was decided later to raze it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nor did the Türi ski jump structures survive the August storm; they were not restored later.</seg>
<seg id="20">The newspaper Punane Täht wrote on 12 August 1967 that cleaning up the cities and towns of fallen trees and branches was going slowly, and residents should pitch in in the cleanup work.</seg>
<seg id="21">Orchards also suffered severely in the storm and the newspaper reported that “party organizations must provide inspiration and guidance in both the cleanup and the grain harvest”.</seg>
<seg id="22">A hurricane is when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.</seg>
<seg id="23">The record for strongest wind gust in Estonia has stood since 2 November 1969, when wind at a speed of 48 m/s was measured on Ruhnu Island.</seg>
<seg id="24">The measurement device on Vaindloo Island broke, and thus the precise speed of the strong wind could not be recorded there.</seg>

<seg id="1">The secret of clean beaches: nightly cleanup and poor beach weather</seg>
<seg id="2">The cooler summer weather means less of a need for cleaning on Tallinn’s beaches.</seg>
<seg id="3">“If the weather is good, there are people at the beach, and if it isn’t there are no people,” says beach cleaning person.</seg>
<seg id="4">Seagulls shriek at Stroomi Beach in North-Tallinn.</seg>
<seg id="5">They get some melodic competition from a tractor rumbling in low gear, which is ploughing stripes into the strand.</seg>
<seg id="6">Actually, it is sifting through the top seven centimetres of sand to collect sea debris and rubbish left by people: bottle caps, cigarette butts and other things.</seg>
<seg id="7">People still come to the beach regardless of whether the water is warm or not.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it’s nice weather, people are at the beach, and if it isn’t, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, the head of cleaning operations for the private company Haabersti Haldus.</seg>
<seg id="9">It’s 6:30am and clean-up on the beach is in top gear because by eight, he expanse must be in order for the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Usov has been on duty since four o’clock.</seg>
<seg id="11">Besides Stroomi, he also watches over Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljassaare Pikakari beach.</seg>
<seg id="12">The amounts of rubbish have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="13">Years ago, there was a lot more of it.</seg>
<seg id="14">People are now able to appreciate the good things doe for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning beaches for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past, if something new was erected, it was broken the next day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now better care is taken of the things at the beach.</seg>
<seg id="17">The price of a clean beach</seg>
<seg id="18">One of the biggest jobs at Estonian beaches is cleaning up the marine debris that washes ashore – the algae.</seg>
<seg id="19">For instance, at Pirita beach, 400,000 tonnes has to be hauled away each beach season.</seg>
<seg id="20">“That’s an unbelievable amount,” notes Usov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another major category is ordinary waste – everything that people leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 1.5-km-long Stroomi beach strand has eight large dumpsters that need to be emptied three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is how much waste is generated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Still, the cooler summer weather has meant that there is one-fifth less waste than otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="25">A third category is things left behind.</seg>
<seg id="26">Most of them are children’s toys.</seg>
<seg id="27">As today’s haul, Usov has shovelled around 10 model cars out of the sand.</seg>
<seg id="28">They will be placed on the wooden boardwalk leading to the beach, to await their owners.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Usually more of them emerge, but this is a normal yield.” Usov already knows that soon he will find them in the sand again.</seg>
<seg id="30">Kids come to the beach and take the toys so they can bury them in the sand again.</seg>
<seg id="31">Rubbish is spread around</seg>
<seg id="32">Haabersti management services representative Erika Scholler says that the tractor sifting work is a nuisance for locals.</seg>
<seg id="33">The noise, which lasts from the night hours to early morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="34">During the day, the work would be impossible.</seg>
<seg id="35">In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.</seg>
<seg id="36">“If we don’t do it, the city district will fine us,” says Scholler.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the goal is to get an international blue flag for Stroomi, similarly to Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Compared to the rest of Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to keep the beaches maintained,” says Scholler.</seg>
<seg id="39">We have more seaweed and stones and it is harder to sift through the sand.</seg>
<seg id="40">But we have less trash on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">Upon hearing talk of trash on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, joins the conversation between the journalist and cleaning workers, noting the current problem areas for the beach.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the morning, it’s a disgusting scene everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="43">The problem is with the birds and bottle collectors, who have turned the trash bags upside down,” says Martin.</seg>
<seg id="44">Although it is a difficult proposition to get people to change their behavioural habits, Martin says he hopes the city government will do something about the waste receptacles and perhaps install lids to keep the birds from poking around there.</seg>
<seg id="45">In general, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi Beach.</seg>
<seg id="46">It can be seen that the city is caring for it.</seg>
<seg id="47">The playgrounds, illuminated and freshly asphalted paths have made it more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="48">Once upon a time, you could roller-skate only on one path,” says Martin.</seg>
<seg id="49">Treasures found at Stroomi: coins, only coins</seg>
<seg id="50">Forty-year-old Dmitri has come to take advantage of the morning lull, combing the beach fringe with a metal detector as a treasure hunter.</seg>
<seg id="51">He doesn’t think that he will find anything valuable today or in future.</seg>
<seg id="52">The gods of the sea are not that generous.</seg>
<seg id="53">“I’ve been doing it for a year and I haven’t found anything valuable yet,” Dmitri says.</seg>
<seg id="54">As an amateur treasure hunter, Dmitri has in his treasure pouch a few euro coins, bottle caps and dangerous nails, which he later throws into the waste bin.</seg>
<seg id="55">Usually it’s coins.</seg>
<seg id="56">“There usually isn’t any gold, rings and suchlike,” the treasure hunter says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="4">In the first half of the film, it occurs to me that it is a business-world version of House of Cards – Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler even have a similar manner of speaking.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the film wears on, the less of the House-of-Cards element there is and the moralistic intentions of the film-makers start becoming more evident.</seg>
<seg id="6">A life-changing experience is when the lead character’s son is diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now he has to make a choice between work and family life.</seg>
<seg id="8">On walks to the Chicago’s towering buildings, his son, who dreams of an architect’s profession, makes his father think about what really matters, like faith, goodness, love…even the Twin Towers attack is not neglected.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, one gets a feeling that the film-makers have set out to make a tearjerker, because even the hardest heart in the audience won’t be able to hold back the tears upon seeing the adorable cancer-stricken boy’s suffering.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the son falls into a coma and his case seems nearly hopeless, the father finally realizes the amorality of his work and does a good deed for an old man who is looking for a job.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now I have a bet I make with myself – if a film has a happy ending, I reward myself with a coffee after the movie, but if I’m wrong, then at least the screenwriter can be praised for a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a second, it seems I will go coffee-less – when his spouse calls Dane from the hospital and he runs toward the hospital room down the hallway in slow motion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The son has made a miraculous recovery, however, and although his father has just lost his job, that, too, proves positive, for now he has time to spend with his family.</seg>
<seg id="14">It’s a feel-good moment for me, too – I’m getting pretty good at predicting the endings of American dramas!</seg>
<seg id="15">Truth be told, the film is very well constructed, all the requisite elements are there.</seg>
<seg id="16">Laughter, tears, the actors are good, and there’s a good moral to the story: money’s not the most important thing in life.</seg>
<seg id="17">The film will no doubt do well at the box office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Foreign street musicians in Tallinn not itching to obtain busking permit.</seg>
<seg id="2">Many foreigners busk in the city centre of Tallinn.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ones Õhtuleht spoke to said admitted they were busking in the Old Town without the city government permit.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, we found three street musicians near the Viru gates. They had just as many dogs with them.</seg>
<seg id="5">It could be clearly see that the dreadlocked musicians wearing ripped clothing were backpacker vagabonds who would really benefit from a shower.</seg>
<seg id="6">In spite of their appearance, the only woman in the group played a tune with a jolly rhythm on the accordion, while one of the men juggled three balls and beckoned to passersby.</seg>
<seg id="7">The third man next to them was sitting on a backpack and calmly smoking a hand-rolled cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their three dogs were unfazed by the passersby.</seg>
<seg id="9">Noemi, the one playing the accordion, and Bob the juggler said that they busked for fun as well as for the money.</seg>
<seg id="10">They were trying to raise enough money to buy tickets for a ship sailing to Finland the same evening.</seg>
<seg id="11">Asked whether they applied for a permit for busking in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.</seg>
<seg id="12">First of all, we didn’t know.</seg>
<seg id="13">Secondly, we’re never in one city for longer than a day or two and generally permits are handed out for a month or the like.</seg>
<seg id="14">There’s no point in paying for that,” said Bob.</seg>
<seg id="15">When we found ourselves by the Viru gates once again about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women had approached the musicians and were telling them to move along.</seg>
<seg id="16">The group with backpacks and dogs moved on to the Viru Keskus crossing to try their luck.</seg>
<seg id="17">Three young Polish men were also busking on Viru Street, one of whom was playing the violin, another the clarinet and a third had even hauled out an electronic piano.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We’re here to offer people entertainment, to spread music and joy and to make money for gas and living expenses,” explained Mivosh, the pianist.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mivosh said they were aware they had to apply for a permit from city government.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Of course we don’t have that,” he said in a light-hearted manner.</seg>
<seg id="21">But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there won’t be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">Naturally, if the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we have to try,” he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">In July, Bank of Estonia bought 149 million euros in bonds as part of the central banks’ government asset programme, and the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to a total of 4.36 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="2">The central bank is not releasing more details on the purchases.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bank of Estonia President Ardo Hansson had previously explained in response to an interpellation from MPs that Eurozone central banks’ asset purchase programme encompasses three different buying programmes: covered bonds, asset backed securities (ABS) and public sector purchase programme (PSPP).</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank buys up bonds on the market, to encourage the investors who sold the bonds to invest money elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">As an effect of the purchases the yield of low-risk assets decreases, and this motivates investors to take bigger risks.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, in the context of the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, other countries’ bonds are not purchased.</seg>
<seg id="7">As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia executes what are called substitute purchases in the amount allocated to it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Central banks also make substitute purchases in countries with a limited supply of the bonds conforming to the purchase programme.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hansson said Bank of Estonia generally buys the bonds of European institutions, such as the bonds of the EFSF and the EIB.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Bank of Estonia has been purchased bonds as part of the asset purchase programme since March 2015.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the interim, Elering bonds were purchased, but as of June 2016, the Bank of Estonia no longer buys Elering bonds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="17">This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="102">Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="105">A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="106">The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.</seg>
<seg id="107">From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.</seg>
<seg id="108">The front page would have to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="109">Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.</seg>
<seg id="110">Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.</seg>
<seg id="111">If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="112">Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="113">"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="44">The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.</seg>
<seg id="45">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="46">The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can count the scales on its sole.'</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">We have nothing to lose but our chains."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 tips for getting over the Weekend Festival hangover</seg>
<seg id="2">After a party with lots of drinking, a certain tougher breed of people find themselves thinking the hair of the dog that bit them might be a good idea.</seg>
<seg id="3">Or they follow the maxim “avoid a hangover, stay drunk.”</seg>
<seg id="4">But this is just putting off the inevitable and is quite a blow to one’s health.</seg>
<seg id="5">What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow’s Weekend festival or other party and get over a hangover as painlessly as possible?</seg>
<seg id="6">Drink water.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after alcohol, after the big party in the morning…or even instead of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the body loses lots of fluid when consuming alcohol, it has to be replenished.</seg>
<seg id="9">Along with the water, minerals are also flushed out of the body, and so it is good to drink mineral water.</seg>
<seg id="10">The stomach lining is often irritated after tippling, so still water or lightly carbonated water is especially good.</seg>
<seg id="11">Take a walk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Certainly it wouldn’t be wise to go split wood at grandma’s – that could be a fateful miscue.</seg>
<seg id="13">But a light walk helps the body remember what it feels like to be alive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lying in a tent and sleeping off a hangover is a more time-consuming way of recovering.</seg>
<seg id="15">Give your body back its energy little by little, carefully.</seg>
<seg id="16">If you’re already experiencing nausea because of yesterday’s overindulgence, it isn’t a good idea to burden your liver with a big fatty meal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Start with fresh juice, containing fruit sugars that will start giving your body sustenance quietly.</seg>
<seg id="18">If your health is doing poorly around lunch, try some bouillon for example.</seg>
<seg id="19">And solyanka meat soup a bit later already.</seg>
<seg id="20">Avoid coffee.</seg>
<seg id="21">This diuretic will rob your body of the last liquid.</seg>
<seg id="22">As already said, water and juice are your friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Don’t count on pain relievers.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you take a pain reliever in the evening to avoid hangover, your liver has to deal with the acetaminophen or ibuprofen in addition to the alcohol and will lose strength.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will do even more damage to your liver and your hangovers will be worse in future.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, pain relievers don’t stay in your body all that long.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you take a pain reliever in the morning, don’t take it on an empty stomach – it will irritate your already inflamed stomach.</seg>
<seg id="28">Or if you don’t have a partner, you can get along well with yourself.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has about the same effect was a walk, except you don’t orgasm on a walk.</seg>
<seg id="30">Avoid a too active pace and wild positions – physical exertion should be moderate during a hangover.</seg>
<seg id="31">Use humour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Talk foolish talk with your friends and co-sufferers, do stupid things and laugh in a friendly manner about your own and others’ (sufferings).</seg>
<seg id="33">Humour and laughter may not drive a hangover away but it certainly makes it easier to tolerate the aftereffects.</seg>
<seg id="34">At some point, every hangover will go away.</seg>

<seg id="1">Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide</seg>
<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Baltics are a shining star of the Eurozone: incomes growing fast</seg>
<seg id="2">Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are quickly approaching the affluent countries of Western Europe in terms of income, Bloomberg wrote, citing a report from the European Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the ECB, starting in 1999, the per capital GDP in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Low debt burden, rapidly improving institution and pro-business and pro-free-market policies are responsible for the success.</seg>
<seg id="5">“The Baltic states along with Slovakia are among the few Eurozone countries where the real per capital gross domestic product measured in purchasing power parity has grown significantly closer to the EU average,” the ECB said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the objective is for per capita gross domestic product to become equal to the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 per capital gross domestic product in the Baltic economies was just 2/3 of the average among the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.</seg>
<seg id="7">Low wages have led Balts to look for better pay abroad.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year as well, local residents are far from enthusiastic.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only one-quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents felt that their economies were doing well or fairly well.</seg>
<seg id="10">Slightly under half of respondents in the Czech Republic and Poland thought the same.</seg>

<seg id="1">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will have security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">We'll do the best we can with what we got.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm not going to worry too much about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We have a plan in place."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition conceived as revenge against the Centre Party, the Meie Tallinn coalition founded by Reform Party outcast Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE outcast Maria Kaljuste, and the Tegus Tallinn coalition of businessmen hoping to show party members their place – it appears that there will be just as many election coalitions, created at the initiative of those who have got their fingers burned in partisan politics, participating in this year’s local elections as there will be political parties.</seg>
<seg id="2">But the chickens will be counted in the autumn and the key question will be whether there will be enough disillusioned voters for them all.</seg>
<seg id="3">Who will stick with Savisaar?</seg>
<seg id="4">The dwindling of his base can be seen in the events organized for the owner of his election coalition.</seg>
<seg id="5">One MP, some former and current Centre Party members and many unknown faces – will this really be the makeup of the election coalition?</seg>
<seg id="6">And might the reason that some of Savisaar’s loyal adherents are refraining from running as candidates in Tallinn be found in the fact that the so-called “Savisaar list” led by the corrupt and those suspected of corruption crimes is becoming a reality?</seg>
<seg id="7">A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government with a Russian language pop song, featuring an appearance by the Lasnamäe district’s mayor; and a very primitive computer game in which the main character Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to ride a bike down a street avoiding puddles and squirrels along his way – is that how the Centre Party will try to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-olds allowed to vote for the first time?</seg>
<seg id="8">We will have to wait to see what other parties imagine a youthful election campaign to be.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whereas instead of entertainment programming, viewers of Kanal 2 or TV3 see only a blank screen starting in early August, there are two choices: to accept that in the future, we will see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels on free-to-air TV, or pay 10 euros to some TV operator each month.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are presumably those who will initially cheer the commercial-free TV experience, yet ultimately – even if reluctantly – pay for TV programming and commercials.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ear-splitting music, loud crowds and trash left on the street – these are the adverse effects of nearly every larger music festival.</seg>
<seg id="12">If one doesn’t want to partake of the revelry oneself, instead of getting hung up about it, it would be worth going off to discover Estonia – and rent out a bed to a festivalgoer for a small fortune.</seg>

<seg id="4">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.</seg>
<seg id="5">The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young Setos in Siberia are moving to town, pensioners back to the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="2">Anatoli Yevseyev is continuing the tradition of the famous Seto goldminers along the river Mana.</seg>
<seg id="3">He works 140 km away from home along the Kuvai, a tributary of the Mana, as a driver for a gold mining collective.</seg>
<seg id="4">It’s a hard job: 12 hours of work for two months straight without a day off and then only 10 days at home and back again.</seg>
<seg id="5">During the three years that he’s worked for the collective, Anatoly has seen gold only once.</seg>
<seg id="6">“The rules are strict there: when you enter they check you thoroughly that you don’t bring any vodka in and when you leave make sure that you don’t take any gold with you,” says Anatoli.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mare Piho talking to a local Seto, Jan, in Haida village, who has told her a lot about his family’s memories in Siberia.</seg>
<seg id="8">The archaic culture of the Siberian settlers, which still survives, is starting to have an effect on the settlers back at home too, because it’s just so amazing, says Mare Piho, who has studied the distant Setos most thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="9">This year marks 30 years since her first research trip to Siberia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since that time, she has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.</seg>
<seg id="11">How many Setos migrated from Siberia at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century to get land here?</seg>
<seg id="12">That’s an unsettled question.</seg>
<seg id="13">I say 8,000.</seg>
<seg id="14">I arrived at this number based on stories told by Siberian Seto men who have also thought about this.</seg>
<seg id="15">It’s hard to say exactly, because back then as many as 30 people could arrive in one group but passports were only given to men.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passport was only given to one individual but there were children, sisters and other female relatives with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Look how big this territory here was!</seg>
<seg id="18">It several times bigger than historical Setomaa.</seg>
<seg id="19">All that had to be cultivated and managed in some way.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Setos came here as peasants, but their life changed, because they found themselves in regions that weren’t tied only to agriculture but also to the river (log barges), gold-mining, industry.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, in New Pechory, many Setos went to work later in the closed city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (which is where the Soviet regime built a uranium plant – J. P.) once it was established.</seg>
<seg id="22">Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region?</seg>
<seg id="23">Yes, they lived in compact fashion.</seg>
<seg id="24">The tradition of intermarriage and families with many children also survived for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was common for families to have seven or eight children.</seg>
<seg id="26">How much did Siberian Seto culture differ from that of the motherland Setos?</seg>
<seg id="27">They’re different, even though the aspects that were brought were once the same there.</seg>
<seg id="28">They brought with them a great many folk costumes.</seg>
<seg id="29">They made them as well, but they always drew a distinction between what they brought with them and what they had made on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="30">Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it’s colder here.</seg>
<seg id="31">Foods changed.</seg>
<seg id="32">For example in Setomaa, meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Where are the Siberian Seto villages located and what kind of life two people live there? /graphic: Alari Paluots</seg>
<seg id="34">The ties with the motherland were spiritually strong, they were considered very important.</seg>
<seg id="35">It seems to me that Setomaa starting to “feed back” there, it’s starting to influence them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The girls who have lived here in these families have heard astonishing stories.</seg>
<seg id="37">Piho is referring to people from the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida Village in early July for the Seto kingdom day and lived in homes for four days - J.P.</seg>
<seg id="38">What is left here is astonishing.</seg>

<seg id="1">“It’s extremely easy to go to and from Tapa, because the city has a great location: at a railway junction and highway crossing,” says opera soloist Reigo Tamm, who is from Tapa.</seg>
<seg id="2">The city has long ceased to be just a military capital; we have a lot of nature, sport and cultural venues and pizza on every corner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tapa is a top-class town!</seg>
<seg id="4">The Valgejõgi river flowing through the city has a little island where Tapa residents traditionally celebrate St. John’s Eve.</seg>
<seg id="5">“You can’t see that lovely place from the train window,” chuckles Reigo.</seg>
<seg id="6">If one isn’t afraid of cold water, the river is swimmable, as it is full of springs.</seg>
<seg id="7">I’ve gone swimming there, it’s completely possible!</seg>
<seg id="8">You can have a picnic on the riverbank for a romantic setting – you can watch the river flowing by and think about the past and future.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have walked there with a girlfriend on occasion.</seg>
<seg id="10">Along with everything else, opera soloist Tamm has practised his arias between the three bridges on the riverbanks: “Since the place is on the outskirts of the town, I won’t necessarily encounter anyone when I’m humming my tunes.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“There’s an amazing view of Tapa from Männikumägi hill, but there’s also recreational trails for running or skiing in winter, and, say, play disc golf – the disc golf course has been established, and the discs can be rented from the sports centre,” says Reigo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Veteran players go there with their own discs, but I haven’t made it there yet.</seg>
<seg id="13">Colleague Rasmus Kull will probably have to be to be invited to Tapa as he is an experienced disc golf player and has his own discs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Maybe he will lend them to me!</seg>
<seg id="15">Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the current opera singer’s childhood.</seg>
<seg id="16">At least during ski lessons.</seg>
<seg id="17">I’ve shed many tears, and had disappointments and triumphs on that hill in the sports part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="18">To say nothing of broken sleds and skis.</seg>
<seg id="19">“The whole city centre is now full of construction works, it is all changing beyond recognition,” says Reigo by way of praise.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tapa’s old and worn-out station building is a very attractive place, where summer performances are staged.</seg>
<seg id="21">I’m very glad that Märt Meos, the director of R.A.A.A.M, in 2012 used embraced my idea and brought his theatre to the station building to put on a summer performance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even though this year’s theatre season just ended with Aleksei Karenin, on 11 August, Elluärkamine (Coming Back to Life) will be performed on 11 August at the railway station, when it will be the 1980s again in the old station building.</seg>
<seg id="23">“The Tapa city festival will be held 11-13 August, and pop-up cafés will open up in the statin building and there will be many cultural events, including a rally race open to the public,” says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old town on those days.</seg>
<seg id="24">The tiny yellow house on the 1st of May Boulevard has been a museum since 1994.</seg>
<seg id="25">“The house is small but there are great many exhibits and a huge amount of information,” says Reigo in praising the place, which is full of the history of the town of Tapa, the majority of which focuses on the railway and the military.</seg>
<seg id="26">Reigo chuckles that if one were to visit all the recommended places in Tapa, one would get hungry, but luckily the small city is full of cafes.</seg>
<seg id="27">“We have good places to eat and sometimes, siting in the café, you feel that you’re abroad,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="28">Educated and younger soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in the pubs and cafes, and thus there’s the odd feeling that you’re in Estonia and in your hometown, but all around you there’s this international set.</seg>
<seg id="29">I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="30">Yes, we have a lot of soldiers about town!</seg>

<seg id="1">The rules for handling of genetic modified crops must be clear.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent draft legislation amending the Release into Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to ministries for endorsement.</seg>
<seg id="3">The amendment to the legislation forgoes the creation of a separate database on locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for handlers; the plant health register will be used henceforth for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also under the amendment, GM crop handlers have the obligation to have a pre-existing agreement with a person engaged in apiculture within a specified radius will be amended.</seg>
<seg id="5">”Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary for there to be clear rules on the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.</seg>
<seg id="6">At least until such time that a decision has been taken to declare Estonia GMO-free,” said the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs, Sigmar Suu.</seg>
<seg id="7">“At the same time, it must be taken into consideration that the measures developed must serve the required purpose, be proportional, and take into account the expenses and administrative burden of both private and public sector,” added Suu.</seg>
<seg id="8">The draft legislation repeals the provisions of the GMOVS on database of locations of GM crops and training to handle GM crops, and establishes requirements on handling GM crops and commencing economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Specifically in connection with apiculture, the current obligation of GM crop growers to notify beekeepers of commencement of growing GM crops will be supplanted with the obligation to achieve, before commencing growing of such crops, a corresponding agreement with the beekeeper.</seg>
<seg id="10">The draft legislation has been sent to ministries for endorsement.</seg>
<seg id="11">All parties have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with it in the draft legislation information system and if desired, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="12">The planned changes affect, above all, persons engaged in the field of plant protection, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is permitted to grow only one GM crop in the EU, including Estonia - MON 810 maize.</seg>
<seg id="14">To this point, no Estonian agricultural producers are interested in growing GM crops.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is the fact that a maize pest, the European stem borer, to which MON 810 is resistant, is not found in Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The varieties of this maize line were bred in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.</seg>
<seg id="17">To gain assurance in regard to the above, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect potential contamination by GM organisms of seeds of summer rape, maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="18">The test results for the samples collected showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the rape, maize and soybean varieties’ seeds did not contain GMOs.</seg>
<seg id="19">From the above, it can be concluded in turn that no GM crops are being deliberately grown in Estonia and it was also confirmed that no accidental contamination has occurred.</seg>

<seg id="2">Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>

<seg id="6">"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.</seg>

<seg id="1">A GSM transmitter was attached to the leg of the latest young common crane on 1 August, this time on Muhu Island.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to bird watcher Mati Martinson, who lives on Sõrve peninsula, the first young crane to get a transmitter was tagged in Sõrve, and this brood is already flying around, has left the nest area and joined the large population roosting on Mullutu-Suurlaht bay.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is because Sõrve does not have any fields of grain, Saarte Hääl reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Tuesday, relatively late for this round of tagging cranes, another young crane got a transmitter, this one on Muhu Island.</seg>
<seg id="5">Martinson says the radio tagging is actually an international project, led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last year one crane named Mati got a GSM radio tag in Türju on Sõrve peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything he does can be viewed over the Internet: How he flew to Spain to spend the winter, stopped for a while on the German-Polish border on the way out, then came to Saaremaa,” said Martinson.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.</seg>
<seg id="3">Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.</seg>

<seg id="2">The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.</seg>
<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grit Šadeiko – peace and happiness come through tears</seg>
<seg id="2">At the 2011 world championships in Daegu, Šadeiko suffered a leg cramp in the last event, the 800 metres, and was carried out of the stadium on a stretcher.</seg>
<seg id="3">Right before that, she had fouled out of the long jump at a tournament in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 2012 European championships in Helsinki were marred by an injury sustained in the javelin throw, but in her debut Olympics in London, she got 23rd with 6013 points.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her bad luck continued, though.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the 2013 Moscow World Championships, the Estonian was on track for an Estonian record when she suffered an foot injury in the long jump.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two years later, she got 15th at the Beijing World Championships, and qualified for the Olympics, but even this was a disappointment for the athlete, who had hoped for more.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šadeiko ran the hardest gauntlet last year when she didn’t get a result in the long jump at the Amsterdam European championships</seg>
<seg id="9">I’d just like to have a decent performance at the heptathlon or similar events.</seg>
<seg id="10">Just once,” confessed Šadeiko.</seg>
<seg id="11">The worst was yet to come: a month later, her Olympics in Rio ended due to a thigh injury at the first hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="12">She had to take time off – whether to continue in the heptathlon at all?</seg>
<seg id="13">Was two days of effort worth all this, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="14">She thought for a long time, but then found peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="15">I achieved mental clarity</seg>
<seg id="16">It’s relatively hard to describe this experience, but I’ve thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Luckily there was time to heal up and reach clarity.</seg>
<seg id="18">“I knew that it wasn’t time to pack up and retire,” says Šadeiko about her self-cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was able to turn a new page and continue with the same momentum.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coach Anne Mägi said it was hard to watch her charge suffering, but she knew that above all, the athlete had to get clear herself on what she wanted.</seg>
<seg id="21">She has been put down so much by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="22">It’s hard to take.</seg>
<seg id="23">“But Grit said she won’t give up and wants to prove to herself what she’s worth,” says Mägi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now there’s some kind of peace within her.</seg>
<seg id="25">She does it for pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Her lust for competing came back in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record at the Götzis with 6,280 points.</seg>
<seg id="27">At this high-level competition, she bested her own top result in the shot put by close to a metre (13.89) and ran a near-record in the hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="28">The heptathlete then realized that it was still far from her best; it only slaked her initial thirst for competing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mägi, who has been coaching her for years, says Šadeiko is a model student.</seg>
<seg id="30">She’s a ready athlete, she’s easy to coach.</seg>
<seg id="31">If something bothers her or is not right, she’ll say so right away.</seg>
<seg id="32">She knows her own body and trusts her intuition.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what we have to start from.</seg>
<seg id="34">I can’t say what exactly has to be done and we follow that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Šadeiko has also found a new approach.</seg>
<seg id="36">“I’m not the kind of person who gives their all in practice,” she says and adds that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because that guarantees a good result.</seg>
<seg id="37">New arrivals in families of friends and relatives bring cheer</seg>
<seg id="38">Šadeiko is also riding high on happy events in the lives of people close to her.</seg>
<seg id="39">Both her former training partners Maris Mägi and her sister Grete recently became new mothers, and the heptathlete draws support from the new additions to their families.</seg>
<seg id="40">“It’s been pretty interesting,” says Šadeiko.</seg>

<seg id="1">A type of alcohol that gives your brain a “workout”</seg>
<seg id="2">Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big wine fan that he believes that wine can give the brain a better workout than anything else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.</seg>
<seg id="4">He says it’s not about the alcohol or how it affects our feelings or thoughts but rather the “very active” process of tasting wine.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sniffing the glass, swirling the wine in one’s mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we make our brain work to create a taste for the wine.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shepherd says the wine molecule don’t actually contain flavour; the flavour is created by the way the wine stimulates the brain.</seg>
<seg id="7">He draws a comparison to how the brain “sees” colours.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The taste isn’t in the wine, the taste is created by the person tasting the wine,” Shepherd says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other factors that influence the creation of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva produced by a person.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, Shepherd admonishes that wine isn’t for getting drunk on.</seg>
<seg id="11">“There’s more to it than that,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">If you take too big a sip, your system is oversaturated.</seg>
<seg id="13">Excessive drinking of wine can hurt instead of benefiting the brain – a 2004 study found those who drank over three glasses of wine risk memory loss, loss of balance and lower mental capacity.</seg>

<seg id="1">The joy of sharing makes everything even cooler, for big as well as for small.</seg>
<seg id="2">There’s always too little time for shared activities, but working out with the rug rats is a good way to combine shared time, play, closeness and physical exertion.</seg>
<seg id="3">And what a convenient solution – no matter where go in the summer, you always have the living dumbbells with you, impatiently reminding you with their little voices: “Let’s work out now!”</seg>
<seg id="4">Start by warming up – playing ordinary hide-and-seek or jogging down a stretch of beach is good.</seg>
<seg id="5">Squats are the foundation of keeping legs and glutes in shape – who wants to take on the shape of a wave-smoothed sand castle over the summer?</seg>
<seg id="6">It’s amazing to use children instead of weightlifting equipment!</seg>
<seg id="7">First of all, it’s safe and convenient, the weight increases little by little at the same pace as the exerciser’s strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">More advanced lifters can also do squats with pretty big kids.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the kid, it’s balance training, they count the repetitions, and it’s fun to be able to sit high and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bigger children can also do squats at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Establish the range of movement by touching the ground and stretching your arms up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Keep your fingers straight, ask your mini-helper to hold on tight.</seg>
<seg id="13">The kid can count repetitions and play coach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Planking is very beneficial but it’s a hopelessly boring exercise for kids.</seg>
<seg id="15">But it can be made more fun!</seg>
<seg id="16">Pretend-plank: form a long plank column through which to take turns crawling through.</seg>
<seg id="17">It’s actually harder than the ordinary version, but much more fun, as you can high-five your friend from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="18">To add resistance, you can stay in the plank position, the little one on your back, and walk around in that position as well.</seg>
<seg id="19">For extra difficulty, you can put a smaller kid piggy-back on your hips, but this exercise is fun for all kids.</seg>
<seg id="20">While you’re at it, scurrying on the sand, your triceps, glutes and abs will get a workout in no time flat.</seg>
<seg id="21">Your kid will descend to your legs so that his or her body weight will be evenly spread out to the front and back.</seg>
<seg id="22">You can link hands for safety.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bend your knees and straighten up.</seg>
<seg id="24">Your tyke can fly, have fun, practice balance and serve as a resistance weight.</seg>
<seg id="25">Life for the little coach is especially jolly when he gets a little kiss at the top of each movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stretching out your legs adds resistance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Make sure that your back stays in a neutral position.</seg>
<seg id="28">The kids themselves will find it much more fun to train abs in tandem and by clapping.</seg>
<seg id="29">Arm action and pulsating squats</seg>
<seg id="30">Keep an eye on the child’s safety, the position of your knee, and keep your back in a neutral position.</seg>

<seg id="1">From the Philippines to the wide world – straw bags journey into the hearts of fashion fans</seg>
<seg id="2">Bags woven of straw are a summer classic that in recent years has become a hit product in its own right, which is de rigueur to hang on an arm for anyone properly enjoying the summer. Despite its humble origins, merchants have managed to tack on a price befitting a hit.</seg>
<seg id="3">A bag woven from straw is one of the things that everyone has had at some point in their life and owning which didn’t conjure up any particular emotions.</seg>
<seg id="4">You just had it and if you didn’t, there was nothing wrong.</seg>
<seg id="5">But now, straw bags are really taking the world by storm, and for the summer months, fashionistas have swapped their sophisticated designer bags for simple bags woven from straw.</seg>
<seg id="6">It’s far from just a beach bag, but just as popular as a purse for urban settings, and bolder women even walk into the office carrying them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yet it would be wise to be certain whether such a summery style is all right with your boss or whether it would be good to stick your day-planner and laptop into a bit more official-looking case.</seg>
<seg id="8">The amount of variety has made straw bags a real summer fling for women.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that catches the eye is that the first thing fashion connoisseurs do when they’re travelling on holiday abroad is rush to the local market as the first thing and buy a straw bag they are loyal to the entire holiday and which accompanies them to the beach, marketplace and while hanging out on the town with girlfriends.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some bloggers have been so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is worth mentioning that demand for the bags is so high among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably have to resort to violence to become the owner of a bag.</seg>
<seg id="12">In some sense the craze is understandable as it is rare to be able to acquire something with hit status in the fashion world for just a few dozen euros.</seg>
<seg id="13">True, crafty merchants have hit upon an easy money making opportunity and thus finer luxury brands are selling straw bags for several hundred or thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">No doubt so that wealthier customers don’t have to feel that they are mere mortals promenading around with some cheap bags.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, you can buy yourself a Dolce & Gabbana straw bag that costs over a thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chanel’s version of the straw bag will set you back about 6,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike most fashion hits, straw bags are not from some big fashion mecca but their origins lie further off.</seg>
<seg id="18">Namely, the straw bags originate in the distant Philippines, from which they spread to the wide world.</seg>
<seg id="19">There, weaving bags from straw is an export business above all and locals don’t often go around with them.</seg>
<seg id="20">It’s claimed straw-weaving techniques date from the 14th century and they are quite similar to ordinary basket weaving.</seg>
<seg id="21">As straw bags don’t have to be woven as strongly as a basket, patterns and other materials can be interwoven into them, which makes the bag more distinctive and, on that account, more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For instance, bags into which coloured ribbons or leather strips have been woven are particularly trendy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Straw bags owe a thank you note above all to actress Jane Birkin, as a bigger fan of straw bags has yet to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="24">Namely, she paired a straw bag with all conceivable clothing ensembles and even went to Cannes film festival with one.</seg>
<seg id="25">No less of a role in the popularity of the bags today is the fact that it’s easy to care for them and unlike all sorts of other totes, they don’t need to be maintained with special products. Water and a damp towel will suffice.</seg>
<seg id="26">As with fad products, brand have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look.</seg>
<seg id="27">For instance, you can buy yourself a lady’s handbag woven from straw or even a tiny shoulder bag woven from straw.</seg>
<seg id="28">It pays to remember that a classic straw bag will not go out of fashion, but a lady’s straw handbag will.</seg>
<seg id="29">But what is a classic straw bag?</seg>
<seg id="30">The type of straw bag that has been considered classic for centuries is reminiscent of a basket, open at the top, with short handles, also made of straw.</seg>

<seg id="2">A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="3">GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.</seg>
<seg id="5">McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="1">Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prime minister: After Brexit, Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders.</seg>
<seg id="2">“Brexit seriously threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland as well as between Great Britain and Ireland,” Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.</seg>
<seg id="3">“I can’t imagine who would gain from this,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current freedom of movement of people and goods, he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,” he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Varadkar said he would prefer Great Britain to remain part of the European Union, or since this is not possible, to remain part of the European Single market.</seg>
<seg id="7">This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another way to make the exit of Britain smoother would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="9">Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “Certainly we could have such an agreement with Great Britain.”</seg>
<seg id="10">An alternative to this would be going back to customs checkpoints, which would be a declaration of historical fragmentation and political failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">“A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace,” said the Taoiseach.</seg>
<seg id="12">He called Brexit “our generation’s challenge” and warned that the outcome could affect all aspects of everyday life for Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Taoiseach met with the leaders of Northern Ireland’s primary political parties on a visit to Belfast.</seg>

<seg id="8">Except for Ott Sepp: “Ott is fine physique-wise, but unfortunately he doesn’t know how to swim.”</seg>
<seg id="9">Avandi has been training hard since February.</seg>
<seg id="10">At first, 4-5 hours a week, but later on, ten hours a week.</seg>

<seg id="13">Tanel Padar, featured as a “good role model” last year, was seven minutes behind Avandi (5:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan was 16 minutes behind (5:50:23), and Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm nearly an hour behind (6:31:53 and 6:45:18, respectively).</seg>
<seg id="14">The overall winner on the men’s side of the Otepää round of the Ironman series was the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, and Ivo Suur was the best among the Estonians with a time of 4:14:09.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 4:24:01, and of the Estonians, Maria Jänese, who was close to half an hour behind Frederiksen with a time of 4:58:58.</seg>

<seg id="17">He came out of the water in 410th place.</seg>
