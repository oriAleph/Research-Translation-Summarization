<seg id="1">Camille Auer wanted to change her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness and is now making art on the theme – "People should have the right to their own body"</seg>
<seg id="2">Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The name of Camille Auer is written on every one of them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of Auer and her identity –</seg>
<seg id="5">decided on who she is on her behalf.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wanted to disclose my personal medical history to highlight the violence of the whole process", Auer says.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here, "process" refers to her sex reassignment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a many-year examination period, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and physicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">The process starts with a referral to diagnose a gender identity disorder. These diagnoses are performed in Tampere and Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="10">Auer's process started four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="11">Before this, she had already been using oestrogen ordered from the internet and was also otherwise far in her own reassignment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even though she felt like a woman, Finnish legislation states that an individual must undergo a reassignment procedure before the gender can also be altered legally.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Act on the Legal Recognition of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002), or the trans act, obligates transgender people to a compulsory sterilisation so that their correct gender can be registered, for example, in the Population Register Centre and their passport.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, each person about to change their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of their inability to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="15">People should have the right to decide on their own body.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This situation is intolerable and in violation of human rights", Auer says.</seg>
<seg id="17">Amendments to the Finnish trans act have been on the table for long.</seg>
<seg id="18">The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight concerns regarding the act, and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obligates parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to adhere to the right of self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="19">The former Government of Finland prepared the amendments to the act under Susanne Huovinen, the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the following elections, the Finns Party received seats in the Government.</seg>
<seg id="21">Now, the amendments are again at a standstill</seg>
<seg id="22">due to internal disagreements that are not even related to this particular act.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Government is not willing to handle the act, as there are disagreements over the amendments within the Government", says Frank Johansson, director of Amnesty Finland.</seg>
<seg id="24">The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.</seg>
<seg id="25">One of these is made of the packages and instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Any visitor to the patient record installation can read, for example, the interpretation a psychologist working in the transgender department of Tampere University Hospital has made of Auer.</seg>
<seg id="27">The psychologist met Camille Auer two times and, on the basis of these meetings, wrote a report that would define Auer's rights to receive treatment and assistance.</seg>
<seg id="28">The patient's sense of reality is reported to be close to shaking.</seg>
<seg id="29">The patient's conception of herself seems to be disorganised as a borderline case and the unstable features of her personality are emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="30">Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill", Auer says.</seg>
<seg id="32">What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her own identity was denied from her.</seg>
<seg id="35">On that day on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and smashed a TV in the waiting room of the transgender department.</seg>
<seg id="36">Later, that TV evolved into a Monument for the Excluded, a work of art through which Auer reflects on her experiences in power and how it is exercised.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their breasts enlarged. But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed", Auer says.</seg>
<seg id="38">You do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.</seg>
<seg id="40">For many, a gender reassignment process is tougher mentally than physically as a result of medical operations.</seg>
<seg id="41">Anyone who undergoes the process meets dozens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender identity.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It's crazy that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don't have sufficient resources", Auer says.</seg>
<seg id="43">Many applying for the process have suffered from mental disorders: depression, anxiety and possibly bullying.</seg>
<seg id="44">By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="45">"If people are not given access to treatment and assistance, their situation may even become worse than it was before the process", says Auer.</seg>
<seg id="46">Auer's personal exhibit also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the exhibition brochure, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and this is something people find hard to accept."</seg>
<seg id="48">Auer has received medicine for her depression. When she started to take hormones, she also started to feel better.</seg>
<seg id="49">She was finally able to put into words the feelings she had had since her childhood and teenage –</seg>
<seg id="50">why her wide chin did not seem to be quite right for her body and why her pectoral muscles were round instead of flat.</seg>
<seg id="51">Auer has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her.</seg>
<seg id="52">Being seen is a basic need.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I need to explain my existence through my words, clothes, voice and motions", she says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.</seg>
<seg id="56">What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="57">"They should know who I am, and they do know it, but they refuse to accept it or can't accept it", she continues.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, not all transgender people want physical alterations.</seg>
<seg id="59">They do not suffer from the body dysmorphic disorder, whereby their body or its parts can cause anxiety or even physical pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">Without the use of hormones or a lengthy examination process, it is not possible to have an official status for one's own gender.</seg>
<seg id="61">"There is no medical basis for these examinations", Auer says.</seg>
<seg id="62">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="63">For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 2014.</seg>
<seg id="64">The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination when it comes to the legal gender.</seg>
<seg id="65">An adult applicant needs to file a written application for a new personal identity code, indicating that they feel like they represent the other gender.</seg>
<seg id="66">After a reconsideration period of six months, the applicant needs to confirm their application in writing, after which the ministry will provide the applicant with a new personal identity code.</seg>
<seg id="67">A similar right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this is also what characterises Auer's exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="68">The exhibition has not been any therapeutic experience for the artist; it is a political and artistic collection.</seg>
<seg id="69">"I want to believe that art still matters and it helps to achieve political changes, during a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights."</seg>

<seg id="1">Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to clarify the CEO's additional pension</seg>
<seg id="2">Yle reports that Mika Lintilä (Centre Party), Minister of Economic Affairs in charge of Government ownership steering, has asked Finnair to clarify the additional pension paid to CEO Pekka Vauramo.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Lintilä, this is in conflict with the Government's definitions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vauramo's additional pension of EUR 130,000 hit the news this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development on incentives paid to directors of listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's additional pension in February.</seg>
<seg id="6">Finnair announced its intention to discontinue additional pensions in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Government has defined that no additional pensions should be used as incentives.</seg>
<seg id="8">The state holds more than half of Finnair.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the company, this decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on ownership steering.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sanctions immediately resulted in heated talks</seg>
<seg id="2">Some time ago, it still seemed that US-Russia relations were turning from cold to hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">When meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Donald Trump, the President of the USA, and Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, seemed to get along nicely.</seg>
<seg id="4">Later on, the relationship has become notably colder.</seg>
<seg id="5">Russia showed a bitter response to the new economic sanctions approved last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">So far, the most stunning response has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev who said that the sanctions bill signed by Trump will result in a "full-scale trade war."</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if the Russian responses were shrugged off merely as exaggerations and aggravations belonging to political rhetoric, the increased tension between the USA and Russia is a fact, following the short honeymoon after Trump's election.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the USA, passing the sanctions act concerning Russia, Iran and North Korea was no simple process.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then again, the US Congress was remarkably unanimous in passing the bill. However, it was told that accepting the bill was much more difficult for the president.</seg>
<seg id="10">Soon after signing the bill, Trump criticised it as being "significantly incomplete."</seg>
<seg id="11">The sulkiness of President Trump was probably caused by Russia, even though it must have also felt disagreeable to sign a bill that limits the president's own power.</seg>
<seg id="12">As is widely known, the USA is investigating Russia's possible involvement in the presidential election and any links between Trump's campaign and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">After a short honeymoon, the relationship between the USA and Russia has turned decidedly colder.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the turnover of White House staff has been high and different scandalous twists and turns have been revealed nearly every day, it seems to be more apparent that US foreign policy is not run by the president, but regardless of the president.</seg>
<seg id="15">Such a situation is in no sense a preferable one.</seg>
<seg id="16">If the Russian relations are a tricky business in the USA, the same goes with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to economic sanctions, the intensified security situation in the Baltic Sea region tightens the relationship.</seg>
<seg id="18">The EU has visibly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relationship with Russia and demanded the execution of the Minsk Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though the EU has remained unified, at least visibly, in its Russian policy, its member states have fairly differing interests.</seg>
<seg id="20">For a member state such as Finland that trades frequently with Russia, economic sanctions are a constant nuisance.</seg>
<seg id="21">The impact of the new US sanctions act remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="22">The EU has feared that sanctions will make the life of many European companies difficult.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Finland, the act may have an impact, for example, on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.</seg>
<seg id="24">Another cause of sourness in Europe is that liquefied natural gas, which is important for US finances, has been excluded from the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trade sanctions are a global way of showing disapproval.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and accurate,</seg>
<seg id="27">or they become harmful rather than useful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="2">Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="3">The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."</seg>
<seg id="13">There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="20">The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="21">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">The torch is not to light the way to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="25">Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB</seg>
<seg id="2">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team</seg>
<seg id="3">UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="4">A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="9">British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the guy on the corner street, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="12">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Eilidh is slightly modest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="20">She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It just shows how far we've come.</seg>
<seg id="27">And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for my captain's speech?</seg>
<seg id="29">Yeah, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="30">I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="31">So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="38">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="43">Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="2">"We have received samples from roughly five locations and online reports from two to three places.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a great showcase for this course."</seg>
<seg id="9">Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's a wonderful place to play golf in.</seg>
<seg id="14">The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."</seg>

<seg id="17">This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Pori Brigade has reported that, so far, no indoor climate problems have been discovered in the building of the signals company in Säkylä.</seg>
<seg id="3">Investigations are still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investigations started after a man had to interrupt his military service as he suspected that his state of health deteriorated due to the poor indoor climate at the barracks.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to lieutenant colonel Mika Holma, chief of staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems regarding the health of other conscripts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It turned out that this was a separate incident, and no other conscripts serving in the same unit have experienced any problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">We take every report seriously, and we wanted to thoroughly investigate this case.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, we are not aware of any indoor climate problem", Holma says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The press release issued by the Pori Brigade says that it was necessary to relocate some material to the barracks to make room for new conscripts in July, which may have increased the volume of dust temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The air may have felt stuffy because of this", Holma says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."</seg>
<seg id="127">Local people want more foreign governments to take note.</seg>
<seg id="128">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="129">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.</seg>
<seg id="131">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="132">Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="133">"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="134">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.</seg>
<seg id="135">Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="136">"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.</seg>
<seg id="137">"What else could we do?"</seg>

<seg id="2">A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="4">The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.</seg>
<seg id="13">For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.</seg>
<seg id="14">Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.</seg>

<seg id="1">EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.</seg>
<seg id="5">At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="7">Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="16">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="19">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="23">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."</seg>

<seg id="1">Finland is getting ready to make legal kilju</seg>
<seg id="2">Making moonshine legal has not even been considered,</seg>
<seg id="3">as the process results not only in alcohol, but also methanol which is toxic.</seg>
<seg id="4">Preparing kilju, a traditional homemade Finnish alcoholic beverage, will be legal next year, while making moonshine legal will not even be considered.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kilju is prepared through fermentation, while moonshine is made by means of distillation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The regulation on distillation is based on the fact that the process results not only in alcohol, but also methanol which is toxic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We haven't seen any political party that is ready to make moonshine legal for everyone", says Ismo Tuominen, Senior Ministerial Adviser from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the ministry originally prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, making the distillation of moonshine legal was not even considered.</seg>
<seg id="9">Furthermore, it was not raised in political debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We didn't talk about making distillation legal", says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (National Coalition Party).</seg>
<seg id="11">She is in the negotiation team of parliamentary groups of parties represented in the Government that discussed the reform of the Alcohol Act.</seg>
<seg id="12">No permission can be obtained for the distillation of moonshine at home, not even with an application.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, its commercial production will remain subject to a licence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule to regulate the production of alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be made at home if it is fermented.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, it will be legal to make kilju at home.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Government wanted to make the regulations governing alcohol simpler.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The new act removes any requirements related to flavouring substances and permits the preparation of kilju", Mäkelä specifies.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the preparation process, ingredients and any flavouring substances produced as a result of the fermentation process must be clearly identifiable in the beverage.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the new act, people can prepare as high volumes of these beverages as they want, and homemade alcohol can also be given as a gift.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it cannot be sold.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Making kilju is no longer a problem related to national health in Finland", Tuominen says.</seg>
<seg id="22">A much larger change took place in 2004 when any restrictions on importing alcohol from Estonia and other EU states were removed.</seg>
<seg id="23">As much as 75 per cent of all alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="24">The alcohol bill is currently being examined by the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Alcohol Act will be discussed in Parliament when the autumn term starts.</seg>
<seg id="26">The plenary session will be on 5 September.</seg>
<seg id="27">The new act will enter into force from the beginning of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The act has been prepared thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's like Parliament had taken a stand", Mäkelä says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice</seg>
<seg id="2">A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="8">Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one has ever been charged with the murders.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."</seg>
<seg id="19">A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">But not one was ever prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="31">Brooks put it more succinctly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"</seg>
<seg id="34">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."</seg>
<seg id="39">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.</seg>
<seg id="41">He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."</seg>
<seg id="44">Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="45">The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I said n---a, get off my property!"</seg>
<seg id="47">Rascona fires back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There's a beat.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="50">Greene laughs the hardest.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's alarmed, confused.</seg>
<seg id="53">Did I go too hard?</seg>
<seg id="54">"No," Greene said through chuckles.</seg>
<seg id="55">"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"</seg>
<seg id="56">"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.</seg>
<seg id="57">"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"</seg>
<seg id="58">And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="61">This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reenactment ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.</seg>
<seg id="65">A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="66">Her voice breaks on every other word.</seg>
<seg id="67">A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="68">The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="69">One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="70">They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="71">Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.</seg>
<seg id="72">As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="73">Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.</seg>
<seg id="74">"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.</seg>
<seg id="75">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="76">The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.</seg>
<seg id="79">"It's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="80">"We know that's not what's in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="81">You did this for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="82">Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.</seg>
<seg id="83">At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.</seg>
<seg id="84">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="85">"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="86">"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."</seg>
<seg id="87">Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.</seg>
<seg id="89">"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="90">"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="91">Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."</seg>

<seg id="2">Can cauliflower leaves be removed before weighing?</seg>
<seg id="3">What about the large top of a pineapple? After all, it weighs who knows how much.</seg>
<seg id="4">People are divided: for some, this is an indication of extreme stinginess, some do not want to pay for the parts that they will not use and that they would throw away anyway.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is an everyday phenomenon in shops.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, empty cardboard boxes have been placed in the vegetable section of K-Citymarket Ruoholahti in Helsinki because many, for example, remove cauliflower leaves.</seg>
<seg id="7">When placed in these boxes, the leaves are then disposed of as biowaste.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to news published by Taloussanomat, shopkeepers are amazed by this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">How much can you really save by removing unnecessary parts before weighing?</seg>
<seg id="10">How effective is this really?</seg>
<seg id="11">Me Naiset magazine tested what the price of a pineapple, artichoke, mushroom, broccoli and cauliflower is after any unnecessary parts are removed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower originally EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 after all the leaves were removed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pineapple: The price of a full pineapple of EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 after the top was removed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Artichoke: The price dropped from EUR 2.60 to EUR 2.40 after the base was cut off.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mushrooms: The total price of two mushrooms was EUR 0.75.</seg>
<seg id="16">Without the base, their price was EUR 0.60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost EUR 1, and the price decreased to EUR 0.80 after the base was removed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Results: If any unnecessary parts are removed, you can save a few dozen cents when buying a single vegetable.</seg>
<seg id="19">In percentage terms, the price decreased by as much as 20 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, you could have saved EUR 1.20 from the aforementioned purchases!</seg>

<seg id="1">Neymar bought out of Barcelona – the Brazilian star signed a five-year deal with PSG</seg>
<seg id="2">AFP reports that Brazilian star player Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).</seg>
<seg id="3">Earlier in Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the release fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish Primera División.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incredible transfer fee of EUR 222 million is the highest fee ever paid in the history of football.</seg>
<seg id="5">The earlier record was held by Manchester United which paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba last summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Primera División froze the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment attempted by Neymar's representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the rules of the Primera División, a buying club cannot pay a fee matching the release clause directly to the seller, but the player must pay himself out of his deal. This takes place by passing the fee through the Primera División.</seg>
<seg id="8">In practice, PSG paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who, through the Primera División, forwarded the funds to Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="9">Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">He will possibly be presented to his new home crowd at PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="11">UEFA to investigate the details</seg>
<seg id="12">In a press release, Barcelona announced that it will send information about the fee to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) so that it can define any disciplinary actions resulting from the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, Javier Tebas, president of La Liga de Fútbol Profesional, the Spanish association of professional football, has suspected that PSG is in breach of the rules of UEFA's financial fair play through its spending.</seg>
<seg id="14">UEFA has the right to impose sanctions on a club that produces losses of more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate these rules.</seg>
<seg id="16">Neymar's transfer to PSG will have an impact on the club's finances for several years, but this impact cannot be evaluated beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="17">UEFA stated that PSG may, for example, sell players at significant fees.</seg>
<seg id="18">PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company from Qatar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Austin Dunn was performing regular maintenance on an airplane at Southwest Florida International Airport with two of his colleagues when the plane was suddenly struck by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="3">The power of the lightning threw Dunn, who was working near the wing, to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dunn was rushed to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had third-degree burns all over his body.</seg>
<seg id="6">"My father called me and said that my brother got electrocuted and is now at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7">I just asked if he's still alive", Austin's sister Autumn says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Austin spent two weeks in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition to burns, he suffered muscle damage and cerebral bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was a rough experience for the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one can expect anything like this.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was a traumatic experience for all of us", Autumn says.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to a representative of the airport, the lightning warning system was on at the time of the accident, and forwarding companies can independently decide whether or not to follow it.</seg>

<seg id="2">British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.</seg>
<seg id="3">The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown</seg>
<seg id="2">Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.</seg>
<seg id="5">Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?</seg>
<seg id="6">Best of luck to you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="1">Average monthly salary EUR 5,300, regardless of education – the "Wild West" of investment advisors</seg>
<seg id="2">The quality of investment advice has raised much debate.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat wrote about Ritva, 68, to whom an investment advisor of a banking firm talked complete nonsense when selling investment products.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regulations governing investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are based on the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive which will be applied starting from the beginning of next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Currently, the evaluation of the competence of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">No competence requirements are defined in the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Finance Finland (FFI) recommends that individuals working in investment services complete its APV1 or AVP2 qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFI has assigned the provision of its qualifications to APV Investment Examinations Ltd, whose qualifications team consists of experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority, universities and companies operating in the field.</seg>
<seg id="10">The qualifications require 12–15 credits and their examinations are prepared by Aalto University Executive Education which offers development services for business management.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its website says that both of its examinations have "fairly extensive requirements."</seg>
<seg id="12">The study material consists of 10–15 books and a number of other guides and journals.</seg>
<seg id="13">Markku Savikko, managing director of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that roughly 70 per cent of those who take the examinations pass.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When it comes to the largest banks, nearly all of their employees who sell investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 qualifications, as this is a mandatory requirement set out in their own rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then again, there are smaller banking firms – I don't want to name any names – whose employees seem to steer clear of these qualifications", Savikko says.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Savikko, there are "a few" banking firms like this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Savikko says that, since 2000, 13,000–14,000 people have completed APV1 qualifications, while roughly 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some banking firms consider the qualifications to offer an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many other business fields are regulated by much stricter competence requirements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Savikko says that the FFI recommendation requires that APV qualifications are completed, as they secure investment-related competence.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Statistics Finland, the average monthly earnings of financial and investment advisors are several thousands of euros, including fees, fringe benefits and profit-based bonuses.</seg>
<seg id="22">The average monthly salary of regular employees is roughly EUR 5,300.</seg>
<seg id="23">The average monthly salary of men in this line of work is more than EUR 5,900 and that of women is more than EUR 4,500.</seg>
<seg id="24">The top ten per cent receiving the highest salary earns roughly EUR 8,100,</seg>
<seg id="25">with men earning more than EUR 9,000 a month and women receiving EUR 6,400 or more.</seg>
<seg id="26">Investment advice in accordance with the Act on Investment Services can only be offered by a licensed company.</seg>
<seg id="27">So far, employees and positions have been governed by means of self-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">An inspection by the Financial Supervisory Authority revealed individual cases where the professional skills and competence of investment advisors were not at a sufficient level on the basis of their actions.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In principle, an employee can sell investment products, even if their professional skills or competence levels are low.</seg>
<seg id="30">Basically, the situation has been unregulated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many other business fields are regulated by much stricter competence requirements", Savikko says.</seg>
<seg id="32">According to Savikko, regulations will become stricter from the beginning of next year as a result of the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).</seg>
<seg id="33">It demands every company to ensure that their employees who offer investment services have sufficient skills.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Financial Supervisory Authority will be authorised to decide what types of skills employees need.</seg>
<seg id="35">Marko Hovi, senior market supervisor at the Financial Supervisory Authority, says that one of the most significant changes is the requirement for the competence and experience of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to the staff of investment service companies and their partner agents who sell products on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="37">Hovi says that, according to the Government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Supervisory Authority will be authorised to decide on the competence and experience required.</seg>
<seg id="38">What the exact levels are will be decided later in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the future, companies must see to necessary training and, if required, monitoring and continuing training.</seg>
<seg id="40">All of this needs to be documented, and companies will be obligated to prove that this has been done.</seg>
<seg id="41">Hovi specifies that, in practice, companies need to define the job descriptions of every employee.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is expected that there will be different requirement levels, depending on whether an employee is an investment advisor or a seller of investment products.</seg>
<seg id="43">According to Hovi, another addition is the requirement to work for a specific period with a more experienced employee, if a person's competence or experience is not at a sufficient level.</seg>
<seg id="44">This means that, if a company recruits a new employee who does not meet the criteria set, that employee needs to work with a more experienced employee for a pre-defined time.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to Hovi, these changes will make the regulations stricter and more concrete.</seg>
<seg id="46">The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter from the beginning of 2018.</seg>

<seg id="9">"We are one of the sponsors of the upcoming film.</seg>
<seg id="10">We support this film, just like many other companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our aim was to support Finnish production and a cult film", Määttä says.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Määttä, the products will be on special display in shops, giving visibility to the film.</seg>
<seg id="13">Isn't there something funny about this? After all, one would think that there is something in common between Sini's products and the stories linked with them.</seg>
<seg id="14">"There's a unifying story in that we are a Finnish company and these are Finnish products", Määttä says.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="12">He's worth about $1.59 billion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lightning wreaks havoc – summer's most intense thunderstorms expected for Thursday</seg>
<seg id="2">At the end of the week, thunderstorms will also reach southern Finland.</seg>
<seg id="3">This week, there have been frequent thunderstorms, especially in central and northern Finland, as well as in southwest Finland.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, strokes of lightning ignited several fires.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a meteorologist, this summer's most intense thunderstorms are expected for Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thundershowers have finally found their way to Finland.</seg>
<seg id="7">This week, there have been frequent thunderstorms, especially in central and northern Finland, as well as in southwest Finland.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Pöytyä, lightning struck the distribution board of a terraced house, igniting a small fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rescue department obtained information about the fire 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The distribution board was located in a sauna at the end of the terraced house.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rescue personnel dismantled parts of the roof and wall in order to locate any fire pockets and extinguished the fire quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but no-one was injured.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Loimaa, lightning set a shed on fire in Harjulantie a little before midnight.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the rescue personnel arrived on site, the building was in flames and the rescue personnel were only able to prevent the fire from spreading.</seg>
<seg id="15">The shed of roughly 50 square metres burned to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Rääkkylä near Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.</seg>
<seg id="17">The residents were outdoors to witness the stroke of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="18">The rescue personnel arrived on site to investigate the situation, but this time the lightning did not cause any fire – it only burnt some fuses.</seg>
<seg id="19">In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a stroke of lightning damaged the traffic control system.</seg>
<seg id="20">Information about the fault was obtained on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 am, after which scheduled traffic was replaced by buses.</seg>
<seg id="21">The problems was only repaired a little before 5 pm,</seg>
<seg id="22">after which railway traffic has continued normally, also in the track section damaged by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thunderstorms have wreaked havoc in different parts of Finland.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, there have been fairly few lightning flashes this summer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This summer's thunderstorms have been utterly rubbish!" says meteorologist Jari Tuovinen from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</seg>
<seg id="26">The intensity of the thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday was mainly moderate but, due to the poor lightning situation this summer, many regarded them as heavy storms.</seg>
<seg id="27">"These could be considered to be heavy thunderstorms, and that's what they were compared with other storms this summer", Tuovinen says.</seg>
<seg id="28">On Wednesday, there were 1,700 flashes of cloud-to-ground lightning, and this summer's most intense thunderstorms are expected for Thursday: by 4 pm, there have already been 1,790 flashes of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="29">"If the storms extend to the evening, we can have more than 2,000 flashes", Tuovinen says.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous record-low lightning year was in 2015 when the flash counter showed a total of 30,000 flashes.</seg>
<seg id="31">By Wednesday, there have been 18,386 flashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is still some catching up to do in order not to break the "record" made two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, more storms can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will be warm and dry throughout the week, forming an ideal environment for thunderstorms.</seg>
<seg id="35">By Saturday, storms are expected to head south where 2,000 flashes can be recorded both on Saturday and on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="36">More constant rain is expected in central parts of Finland.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to Tuovinen, such weather rarely generates lightning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal</seg>
<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1">Medal for Finland from World Championships in London like a miracle</seg>
<seg id="2">The IAAF World Championships in London will start this Friday, ending after a little more than a week on Sunday 13 August.</seg>
<seg id="3">Finnish audiences are passionate about athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey and follow them faithfully year after year, through thick and thin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sports fans measure success by the number of medals won.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, there are other indicators as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less attention is paid to the wonderful stories of young athletes who gain experience by going from one competition to the next to raise their performance up to a level where they can have a true chance of winning a medal in open competitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This time, the not-so-big Team Finland does not have such young athletes, or any veterans for that matter.</seg>
<seg id="8">Winning a medal would be a miracle.</seg>
<seg id="9">Luckily, nearly anything can happen in sports.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sports draw audiences in front of their television sets to watch different events, even though this year's finals will be held late at night due to the time difference between London and Finland.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the previous IAAF World Championships in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal</seg>
<seg id="12">by Tero Pitkämäki in javelin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The most hopeful ones are expecting Pitkämäki to bring home another medal, even though the results of Pitkämäki and other throwers, as well as his elimination from the finals in European Championships last summer, say otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="14">No matter what happens in this competition, Pitkämäki will remain in history as one of the great Finnish sports heroes.</seg>
<seg id="15">For other Finnish athletes, reaching the finals or making a personal best would be a good result.</seg>
<seg id="16">The success of our young athletes in international competitions, also this summer, gives us hope that Finnish athletes have a realistic chance of winning a medal in future competitions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Growing young talents and supporting them financially is more important that maintaining a small elite group of top athletes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Success takes years of hard work from athletes and patience from coaches and fans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Finnish sports fans also respect international sports stars and enjoy their incredible results.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hopefully, the World Championships in London remain in history because of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorism or cowardly attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="2">So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="6">By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="8">At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the core stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="13">As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="17">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="20">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).</seg>
<seg id="22">And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.</seg>
<seg id="23">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="24">At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Toni Tauru from Kouvola is ready to fight in Macau on Saturday – against a former UFC fighter</seg>
<seg id="2">Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.</seg>
<seg id="3">Toni Tauru will face a tough opponent in Macao, as Leandro Issa from Brazil fought in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Brazilian also has a black belt in jiu-jitsu and he has won the World Jiu-Jitsu Championships.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For once, I'm fighting an opponent who is older than me,</seg>
<seg id="6">and that'll be fun", says Tauru, 32.</seg>
<seg id="7">Originally, the fight was to be held in Indonesia last Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the event was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were quickly moved to Macau.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tauru has never experienced anything like this before.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This was the first time my fight was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was annoying, as it took a lot of time training and preparation."</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the fighter was happy to see that the fight was rescheduled.</seg>
<seg id="13">One week of waiting does not cause many changes in preparations.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This move doesn't change my physical condition, as it can't be much improved in a week.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it can get worse if I train too hard."</seg>
<seg id="16">In some of his previous fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths were in stand-up fighting.</seg>
<seg id="17">This time it is a different story.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tauru describes Issa as a typical Brazilian fighter.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He's fairly aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="20">My guess is that he'll come at me hard in the first round, trying to knock me down.</seg>
<seg id="21">He knows how to wrestle. After all, he has won the World Jiu-Jitsu Championships."</seg>
<seg id="22">Tauru's last fight did not go according to plan.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kevin Belingon from the Philippines landed a nasty blow in the corner of Tauru's eye and claimed the win.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It was my best fight, especially standing up: he didn't land a single punch.</seg>
<seg id="25">When I tried to take him down, he hit me in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="26">I felt bad about it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="27">New motivation</seg>
<seg id="28">Some fighters have a few matches a year, while some fight more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, Issa's last fight was in September,</seg>
<seg id="30">while Tauru had three fights last year.</seg>
<seg id="31">This will be the second fight of the year.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pace has felt heavy at times.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In recent years, I've trained and been fit all the time.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, I've only fought for the sake of fighting."</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="1">She teaches us with sweet chilli</seg>
<seg id="2">In summer 1996, a booth was set up in the Lahti market square selling Thai food.</seg>
<seg id="3">Those living in Lahti didn't have the courage to have a taste, they simply walked by.</seg>
<seg id="4">The booth was set up by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, or Panja to those who knows her.</seg>
<seg id="5">She barely spoke Finnish, and the Thai language wasn't widely spoken in Finland at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because people didn't have the courage to go and eat, Panja offered free bites.</seg>
<seg id="7">And so she taught everyone living in Lahti how to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Go on, taste it, taste it", she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was immediately hooked.</seg>
<seg id="10">I used to go more often, eventually every day.</seg>
<seg id="11">In summer 1997, Panja opened a Thai restaurant in the Lahti market hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">It consisted of two small tables, with room for no more than 20 customers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not only did she teach us to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When you're hungry and not many seats are available, you can't leave an empty seat between yourself and a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="15">Slowly, we got to know each other better and became friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">Finally, I sat there eating, reading a dictionary and trying to learn the Thai language.</seg>
<seg id="17">The restaurant operated in the market hall for two years, after which it had to move because it was said that the aromas from Panja's homemade curry pastes were too intense.</seg>
<seg id="18">A new spot became available at the end of the market hall,</seg>
<seg id="19">with more space.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now we can be grumpy at our own tables. Only during the busiest hours do we need to timidly ask strangers whether the seat next to them is available.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panja knows her customers.</seg>
<seg id="22">We tell her how we are doing, where we have been and who we have seen.</seg>
<seg id="23">She knows what each of us eats.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has seen how her customers pass from one situation on to the next and how their dinner companions change.</seg>
<seg id="25">She remembers the name of the man with whom I had my first spring rolls.</seg>
<seg id="26">She remembers when I was skinny and when I was fat, and she knows what I was like when I was younger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's nice to have lunch after everyone else, take a seat in my own place next to the kitchen door and talk this and that with Panja who is leaning on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="28">Food isn't the most important thing she has given us.</seg>
<seg id="29">She has taught us tolerance and given us a world view, served with sweet chilli.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to our sense of taste, she has opened up our hearts and minds.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, many speak to her in Thai – thanks to more extensive travel opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="32">I admire Panja.</seg>
<seg id="33">She's always friendly, even though she too has faced tough times.</seg>
<seg id="34">She works hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to her days in the restaurant, she enjoys picking mushrooms and bilberries.</seg>
<seg id="36">Last week, we quietly celebrated the 20th anniversary of the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="37">Panja served us customers strawberry cake for dessert.</seg>
<seg id="38">There was no fuss or big noise to mark the event; it was just another day at work.</seg>

<seg id="2">Earlier this year, security authorities got their hands on a significant list considering the battle against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="3">The list contains information about more than 170 Isis terrorists who are ready to attack in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to German Die Welt, there are 173 listed persons in total, and the list includes personal details and photos of each individual.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the listed persons, 130 come from Iraq, but there are also six Europeans</seg>
<seg id="6">from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">Others are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ilta-Sanomat reported the discovery of the list two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, the location where the list was found and the information it contains have been specified.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Die Welt, special forces of the Iraqi army found the list, containing personal details and photos of terrorists, as they were going through an underground base of Isis in Mosul.</seg>
<seg id="11">US intelligence authorities examined the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interpol distributed the list to the security authorities of all European countries in May.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were fears that terrorists were planning something large and serious in the west, as Isis was taken down in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Die Welt, the list contains the names and photos of all listed persons, as well as their dates of birth, aliases and information about their home country.</seg>
<seg id="15">The list also specifies the specialty of each terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For example, the alias of Sami J., a 27-year-old from Germany, is Abu Assid al-Almani, or the German.</seg>
<seg id="17">The list says that he left Germany in 2012, going first to Egypt, followed by Libya and Turkey, before he went to Syria to join Isis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Next to his photo, suicide bomber is written as his specialty.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not known what has happened to him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brothers fight over $500 million property empire</seg>
<seg id="2">Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">It sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="10">A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.</seg>
<seg id="15">Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="20">They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="22">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="26">Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bestselling author Raija Oranen beat alcoholism and fear of flying through hypnosis: "I've never felt better"</seg>
<seg id="2">Bestselling author Raija Oranen, famous for Finnish TV series Ruusun aika and Puhtaat valkeat lakanat, recently celebrated her 69th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hypnosis helped Raija Oranen.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her five grandchildren, together with writing, keep the grandmother so busy that Raija and her husband Jyrki decided to give up the Spanish sun and their apartment in Fuengirola after 18 winters.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, they sold their house, and this spring they terminated their lease agreement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Originally, Raija was driven to the light and sun by her depression and alcoholism which she has subsequently beaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">She is also 20 kilograms lighter.</seg>
<seg id="8">"My weight started to drop when I stopped eating serotonin for my depression.</seg>
<seg id="9">I got help for my alcoholism from hypnosis which also helped me to beat my fear of flying.</seg>
<seg id="10">I haven't had a drink in 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Alcohol starts to control you", the radiant author says openly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been together for more than 45 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I've never felt better."</seg>
<seg id="14">Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the travel industry, have already been together for more than 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I proposed, and we got married in two weeks", Raija says laughing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"She's always been such a drama queen, ending her life every now and then", Jyrki says.</seg>
<seg id="17">Having had a notable career as an author, Raija Oranen has nothing but good memories of the 44-episode Puhtaat valkeat lakanat series which touched and moved Finnish viewers during the recession of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I finally decided that the Raikas family works in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th birthday interview on an aeroplane.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was the daughter of a dressmaker. My mother also had her own shop, and I used to work as a model for her", Oranen remembers.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Oranen, the series changed what Finnish people think about business life.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Anita Savelainen's study and dissertation proved it", Oranen says.</seg>
<seg id="22">Raija Oranen is busy writing – she is working on many scripts, and hundreds of ideas.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="17">This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Men who made emergency landing on a packed beach in Portugal were heard at court today.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of the crash landing, two people died yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two men who piloted the plane may be indicted for negligent homicide.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Portugal, the most severe punishment for negligent homicide is 16 years of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="6">A technical fault forced the light plane piloted by the two men to crash land on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the time of the crash, the beach was full of people, some of whom escaped the crashing plane by running in the water.</seg>
<seg id="8">When landing, the plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.</seg>
<seg id="9">The plane first hit the man who had his back turned towards the plane.</seg>
<seg id="10">Filipe Janeira who was at the beach told Jornal de Noticias that immediately afterwards the plane ascended and, when it descended again, it hit the child in the head.</seg>
<seg id="11">The deceased girl was at the beach with her parents</seg>
<seg id="12">who were not injured.</seg>
<seg id="13">Immediately after the crash, enraged people surrounded the crashed plane.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celia Rocha who witnessed the incident told Correio de Manha that the girl's father and other people ran to the plane and started banging on its rear.</seg>
<seg id="15">The man called the pilot a criminal – he was desperate.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is a wonder that no more people were killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won another gold medal in World Championships: "Without the accident, I wouldn't be the World Champion"</seg>
<seg id="2">Early on Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari won the gold medal in the banked slalom event in the World Championships held in Big White, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="3">Earlier, Suur-Hamari had also won the cross event.</seg>
<seg id="4">Altogether, he now has three gold medals in World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="5">"These World Championships have been pretty amazing!</seg>
<seg id="6">We've won two gold medals and are really pumped up", said Suur-Hamari who was contacted by telephone.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 30-year-old rider thanked his coach and his excellent preparations in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Suur-Hamari, the number of challengers is constantly increasing.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Para-snowboarding has grown and evolved notably.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gaps between racers are becoming smaller, and there are a number of new riders.</seg>
<seg id="11">I always think that there is someone new ready to beat me.</seg>
<seg id="12">Every competition seems to have a different winner."</seg>
<seg id="13">Suur-Hamari lost one of his legs in a motorcycle accident in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has always been an enthusiastic snowboarder ever since his childhood and the accident could not keep him off the slopes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Every now and then I can't help but wonder what my life would've been like without the accident.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, I've always thought that there's no going back.</seg>
<seg id="17">You play the hand you're dealt", Suur-Hamari stresses.</seg>
<seg id="18">It would be cruel to say that the serious accident and losing a leg were a stroke of luck, and Suur-Hamari does not.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, he was able to turn his difficulty into an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'd say that everything turned for the better.</seg>
<seg id="21">I wouldn't be a three-time World Champion without the accident."</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamari was losing interest in snowboarding.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I really started working to reach the top after the accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">When I was younger, I trained with my friends, and we were always watching the X-Games.</seg>
<seg id="25">They were only distant dreams that nearly died as time moved on.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the accident, I somehow found myself racing at the X-Games.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't have imagined it.</seg>
<seg id="28">I was 23 and I thought that this will be a long life if I stay here feeling bitter and feeling sorry for myself.</seg>
<seg id="29">I decided to roll up my sleeves and start working.</seg>
<seg id="30">I'd say that I've succeeded quite well."</seg>
<seg id="31">The rider was elated when wheelchair racer Leo-Pekka Tähti was selected the Athlete of the Year in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="32">The four-time Olympic gold medallist received the award at the Sports Gala held in May.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to Suur-Hamari, this recognition is an important signal for parasports.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It was huge, and Tähti absolutely earned it.</seg>
<seg id="35">This will undoubtedly turn eyes towards parasports."</seg>
<seg id="36">When will be the time to launch the campaign for selecting two-time World Champion Matti Suur-Hamari the Athlete of the Year?</seg>
<seg id="37">"We'll see.</seg>
<seg id="38">I'm doing my best to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="39">So far, Suur-Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he wants.</seg>
<seg id="40">He has set a major goal for next year</seg>
<seg id="41">when the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="42">"My goal is to win a medal!"</seg>

<seg id="9">This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey identified the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="10">In February and March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18–24 responded to the survey. Half of these were women and half were men.</seg>
<seg id="11">Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, more than half of all young Syrian refugees do not expect to make a permanent return to their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of all respondents, 42 per cent thought that they might return to their homeland and four per cent did not know whether or not a return is possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the survey, key factors among young Syrians are the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nearly half (47 per cent) of all respondents thought that the end of the war is the most significant factor affecting their return home, while one quarter considered that driving Isis out of the country is the key factor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Monty Widenius spends half his time coding in Kauniainen to keep the internet in perfect order – his database is used by Wikipedia and Google</seg>
<seg id="2">MariaDB, a company based in Espoo, is developing "the world's fastest growing" open source database.</seg>
<seg id="3">The main product of MariaDB, established by coder and entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, is free of charge for its users, and it can be developed by any skilled programmer through the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, Google and Wikipedia use the Finnish database, but they may not be any paying customers.</seg>
<seg id="5">With databases, huge volumes of data can be kept in order and quickly available.</seg>
<seg id="6">If you use, for example, LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, you are using the database of MariaDB or MySQL.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All information that is not in image format, comes from a database, and that is where images are also linked", Widenius says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Widenius, who works as the CTO of MariaDB, spends half of his time coding.</seg>
<seg id="9">Working remotely from Kauniainen, Widenius makes sure that the Internet works as it should.</seg>
<seg id="10">Widenius, together with David Axmark from Sweden, is the developer of MySQL, the world's most popular open source database.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL at a price of one billion dollars and, a year later, software giant Oracle acquired Sun at 7.4 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the Oracle deal landed, the majority of MySQL developers announced their intention to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They didn't want to work for Oracle which didn't give a definite promise of the future of MySQL", Widenius says.</seg>
<seg id="14">At this stage, he had already established a company to develop MariaDB.</seg>
<seg id="15">He did not want to see his life's work die.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I hired the twenty best developers from Sun and made sure that the code stays safe in the hands of the same people who created it in the first place."</seg>
<seg id="17">Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop a new branch from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Only the name had to be changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">A foundation was set up to supervise that the code of MariaDB can be developed freely.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We didn't use similar safeguards when developing MySQL", says Widenius.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though many have heard of Widenius and the billion dollar MySQL deal, not many in Finland know anything about MariaDB.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In recent years, we've ground by about 50 per cent a year", says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO at MariaDB.</seg>
<seg id="23">At this point, MariaDB focuses on growth, not on profit, and Paqvalén has little to say about the company's key figures.</seg>
<seg id="24">He does reveal that MariaDB expects to obtain new orders worth 20 million euros during this financial period.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because the database is free of charge, the company has developed auxiliary services for which corporate customers are ready to pay.</seg>
<seg id="26">MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may take more than a year if a customer has used a closed database.</seg>
<seg id="27">A switch from MySQL to MariaDB is quick and easy, as the two are different versions of each other.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, Telefónica, a Spanish telecom operator, and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are paying customers of MariaDB.</seg>
<seg id="29">The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Alibaba Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.</seg>
<seg id="30">At the same time, MariaDB spreads automatically to new users through Linux operating system packages in which MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even though we are a small company, we are connected to major players.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Our customers include the world's largest telecom operators, game developers, banks and even a few central banks", Paqvalén says.</seg>
<seg id="33">The database market is still dominated by giants, such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP, with their closed databases.</seg>
<seg id="34">For Oracle, MySQL means a modest secondary business opportunity compared with its traditional closed database.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even though the largest database companies have lost their market shares according to research company Gartner, players such as MariaDB are small and insignificant firms, albeit quickly growing ones, measured by net sales.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the database market of roughly 50 million dollars, open source databases cannot even reach the threshold of one billion.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the significance of open source software cannot be measured in money alone, as the majority of users do not pay anything for its use.</seg>
<seg id="38">Gartner estimates that, in 2018, companies will develop more than 70 per cent of their internal applications using open source databases.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, more than half of older databases will be replaced by open source databases, or at least this transition will have been initiated.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Major corporations do not obtain new customers, as most users select open source software.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the licence fees of commercial databases are sky high.</seg>
<seg id="42">Companies want to make as much money as they used to do, with fewer customers", Widenius says.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because it takes a lot of work to replace a closed database, most customer companies have quietly accepted the increased prices.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We have many customers for which it's really difficult to make this transition, because their applications and other solutions are tied to a closed database", says Widenius.</seg>
<seg id="45">He still believes that customers will soon have had enough.</seg>
<seg id="46">As licence fees go higher year after year, customers will eventually switch to an open source database.</seg>
<seg id="47">The price is 10 to 20 per cent of what it was and service is better, as customers can easily change to another database.</seg>
<seg id="48">Besides, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their functions to cloud services.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, many want to change their database software.</seg>
<seg id="50">Last spring, MariaDB acquired a loan of 25 million euros from the European Investment Bank (EIB).</seg>
<seg id="51">This was the largest growth loan ever given by the EIB in the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">The company has 115 employees around the world, and it intends to hire more.</seg>
<seg id="53">One reason for obtaining funding from the EIB was the impact MariaDB has on public IT procurement.</seg>
<seg id="54">The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, among others.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Europe, the public sector is paying billions of euros a year for databases.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Many countries want to adopt open source solutions and, therefore, use tax revenue more effectively", Paqvalén says.</seg>
<seg id="57">Widenius is not happy about how Finland is spending money on, say, closed healthcare systems, while open source systems are cheaper and do not tie the client to a single software company.</seg>
<seg id="58">Some say that open source is an ideology, but I believe that it is a better way of coding.</seg>
<seg id="59">A community helps and creates something you cannot invent or do.</seg>
<seg id="60">Alongside another Finn, Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux, Widenius, 55, is one of the best known contributors to open source software.</seg>
<seg id="61">Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source.</seg>
<seg id="62">I still give four to five speeches on open source in different parts of the world.</seg>

<seg id="5">The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="16">Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="2">A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.</seg>
<seg id="6">My son was my best friend."</seg>
<seg id="7">Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She ended his life to better her own.</seg>
<seg id="12">She has not accepted responsibility," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="14">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="16">A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="25">Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.</seg>
<seg id="26">The case has divided legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="2">Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, commented on Thursday that relations between NATO and Russia have become significantly colder.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I think it is correct to say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">"At the end of the Cold War, we hoped to develop a close partnership with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">But particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued Russian destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to avoiding a further spike in tensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"As long as we are strong, as long as we are predictable, we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escalation and avoid a new Cold War."</seg>
<seg id="9">Stoltenberg’s remarks came as Donald Trump stated that the relationship between the USA and Russia is at an all-time and very dangerous low.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump blamed the US Congress for the poor relationship, as it approved new sanctions on Russia last week.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Provence lavender under threat from climate change</seg>
<seg id="2">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5">This affects the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."</seg>
<seg id="7">And a lot is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have fewer parts with essential oil."</seg>
<seg id="11">Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="102">Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="105">A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="106">The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.</seg>
<seg id="107">From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.</seg>
<seg id="108">The front page would have to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="109">Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.</seg>
<seg id="110">Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.</seg>
<seg id="111">If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="112">Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="113">"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"</seg>

<seg id="2">Hannu Manninen turned 39 in April, but did not celebrate long, as the professional pilot started to prepare for the Olympic season.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the training period had a catastrophic start when Manninen caught the flu.</seg>
<seg id="4">This turned into a long period of illnesses, stretching to five weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">In practice, Manninen was ill throughout May.</seg>
<seg id="6">"First I had the flu and finally an ear infection, for which I had to take antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was able to complete some ten per cent of the planned training sessions.</seg>
<seg id="8">I don't remember the last time I was that sick.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was tough – I was hungry for training, but I just wasn't able to do anything", Manninen says to Ilta-Sanomat.</seg>
<seg id="10">Test results came down</seg>
<seg id="11">The gold medallist in 2007 World Championships was only allowed to train during the second week of June. This was reflected in the results of the treadmill test conducted by KIHU – the Research Institute for Olympic Sports – on 12 June.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the test, an athlete uses roller skis to ski on a treadmill, the speed of which increases every three minutes.</seg>
<seg id="13">After every three-minute period, the treadmill is stopped for ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingertip.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last autumn, I was able to keep going for 32 minutes, but now I had to stop after 28 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="15">I hit the wall", Manninen says.</seg>
<seg id="16">Heading in a better direction</seg>
<seg id="17">After initial difficulties, Manninen says that he has stayed healthy.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I've carried out slow aerobic exercises to return my metabolism back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last five weeks have been really good.</seg>
<seg id="20">During Midsummer, I also had a break of a week and a half from flying.</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to spend some time with my family at our holiday home."</seg>
<seg id="22">Last season, Manninen only raced in four World Cup competitions before the World Championships in Lahti.</seg>
<seg id="23">Manninen reached his best position in the opening competition when he climbed up to 18th place after an excellent skiing performance.</seg>
<seg id="24">Goals have been set</seg>
<seg id="25">Manninen and Petter Kukkonen, head coach of the national team, have prepared a training and racing plan up to February.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We are looking for a different training rhythm compared with last season.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season opener is followed by a weekend of three World Cup starts in Ruka.</seg>
<seg id="28">In December, the plan is to take part in at least one World Cup weekend, possibly in Ramsau.</seg>
<seg id="29">Then, the plan is to race in Seefeld at the end of January.</seg>
<seg id="30">After that, I hope that my name is on the list of the Olympic team", Manninen says.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Olympics in PyeongChang would be the sixth Winter Games for Manninen.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The important thing is to stay healthy", emphasises Nummela-based Manninen who won the gold medal in the team event in Salt Lake City in 2002.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="44">The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.</seg>
<seg id="45">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="46">The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can count the scales on its sole.'</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">We have nothing to lose but our chains."</seg>

<seg id="1">A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2">In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.</seg>
<seg id="7">By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="14">And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.</seg>
<seg id="15">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="17">That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="20">In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."</seg>
<seg id="21">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="22">By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="23">"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.</seg>
<seg id="24">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."</seg>
<seg id="25">The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.</seg>
<seg id="26">It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="28">"So never shut up."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I get goosebumps still talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="31">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."</seg>

<seg id="1">Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide</seg>
<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="3">"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="4">The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="16">RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.</seg>

<seg id="1">British organisation sceptical about beloved Finnish innovation: "no evidence" of health benefits of maternity package</seg>
<seg id="2">A British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish maternity packages.</seg>
<seg id="3">BBC and Guardian, among others, report that Lullaby Trust, a charitable organisation aiming to prevent unexpected deaths in infancy, forbids the use of its brochures in maternity packages handed over in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="4">Distributing maternity packages to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Packages will also be distributed in some parts of England.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduced the risk of sudden infant death,</seg>
<seg id="7">a medical condition where a baby dies suddenly for no obvious reason.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lullaby Trust acts as an expert for health authorities in the UK in terms of a safe night's sleep for children.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We no longer permit our official brochures to be included in maternity packages, as this would mean that we are in favour of this product", the organisation announced.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Lullaby Trust, this low rate results from many reasons, such as the low number of teen rapes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Handing out one package for each family may be a factor.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, this cannot be said for certain", says Francine Bates, Chief Executive of Lullaby Trust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and sudden infant deaths."</seg>
<seg id="15">The maternity package is a Finnish innovation, and it has been distributed to all Finnish mothers free of charge for 80 years.</seg>
<seg id="16">The package contains various products, such as baby clothes.</seg>
<seg id="17">This year's package contains 53 different products.</seg>
<seg id="18">The package itself is a cardboard box in which babies can sleep.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed in Scotland fulfil all safety standards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard set for cardboard boxes acting as beds.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for a place to sleep if no bassinet or crib is available.</seg>
<seg id="22">The organisation only recommends the package for naps and advises that its use should be stopped when the baby is able to turn to their side.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, the organisation recommends that pets be kept away from the package and that it is not allowed to get dirty or wet.</seg>

<seg id="2">Staff at a Japanese zoo looking for an escaped tortoise.</seg>
<seg id="3">The quickness of the giant tortoise has taken the staff by surprise, as the tortoise made its second escape in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tortoise escaped from the Shibukawa zoo located in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="5">The security footage shows that the tortoise escaped through the main entrance.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It won't die quickly because it'll eat grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned", says Yoshimi Yamane, a zoo employee.</seg>
<seg id="7">The escaped 35-year-old tortoise is female, weighs 55 kg and is about 1 m in length.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yamane says that the fugitive has a quiet and kind nature.</seg>
<seg id="9">During opening hours, the tortoise is allowed to move around freely in the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="10">The zoo has not received any eyewitness accounts of the tortoise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tortoise made its previous escape two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yamane discovered it walking on a road some 150 m from the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I saw it on my way to the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="14">I stopped my car and asked my colleagues to help me", Yamane said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It can walk faster than we could ever imagine."</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="2">Olli Luukkainen, president of the Trade Union of Education (OAJ), said on Thursday that the development of salaries cannot be lower than, for example, in the exports industry.</seg>

<seg id="4">"We are not able to make deals in which these holiday pay cuts were not included in one way or another."</seg>

<seg id="1">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will have security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">We'll do the best we can with what we got.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm not going to worry too much about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We have a plan in place."</seg>

<seg id="2">A presidential election will be held in Rwanda in central Africa on Friday with little doubt over the winner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third term but, in practice, he has had his say in leading the country since 1994.</seg>
<seg id="4">That was when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) stopped the genocide organised by Hutu extremists.</seg>
<seg id="5">The RPF was led by Kagame.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kagame has been criticised, for example, for crushing the opposition and limiting freedom of speech.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kagame is able to run for his third term because the constitution, limiting the presidency to two terms, was amended.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, Kagame is a truly liked leader in Rwanda.</seg>
<seg id="10">During his presidency, social reforms have been made and international investments have flown into the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is more, Kagame has played an important part in unifying the country divided by the genocide.</seg>
<seg id="12">The success of Rwanda has made many Africans doubt whether a liberal multi-party democracy is the right way for African states.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, Kagame has promised more freedom for Rwandans once the country is back on its feet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story</seg>
<seg id="2">In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"That's his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="10">And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.</seg>
<seg id="11">To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="13">For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="15">He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."</seg>
<seg id="17">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."</seg>
<seg id="19">Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just let it go, guys!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe the two are connected?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="28">Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."</seg>
<seg id="29">With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="31">But Scotney holds a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I was sad to leave," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"</seg>

<seg id="3">Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I think it is correct to say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">"At the end of the Cold War, we hoped to develop a close partnership with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued Russian destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to avoiding a further spike in tensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"As long as we are strong, as long as we are predictable, we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escalation and avoid a new Cold War."</seg>
<seg id="9">Stoltenberg’s remarks came as Donald Trump stated that the relationship between the USA and Russia is at an all-time and very dangerous low.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump blamed the US Congress for the poor relationship, as it approved new sanctions on Russia last week.</seg>

<seg id="2">Long-time heavyweight champion in professional boxing Wladimir Klitschko retires.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ukrainian Klitschko, 41, announced his retirement on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gold medallist at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, Klitschko had 69 fights as a professional, winning 64 times.</seg>
<seg id="5">He held different titles in 2000–2002 and in 2006–2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">Klitschko lost the two last fights of his career.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tyson Fury beat him by the unanimous decision of the judges in November 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost the fierce fight via technical knockout in the 11th round.</seg>
<seg id="9">Joshua and Klitschko were expected to have a rematch in Las Vegas in November.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Klitschko was unable to find motivation for the fight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I deliberately took a few weeks to make my decision, to make sure I had enough distance from the fight at Wembley Stadium", Klitschko told in his press release.</seg>
<seg id="12">"As an amateur and a professional boxer, I have achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.</seg>
<seg id="13">I would have never imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm very thankful for this."</seg>
<seg id="15">Watch a video of Klitschko's retirement announcement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte told that the decision to retire was a difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="17">"But he has always emphasised that he wanted to retire if he didn’t have enough motivation anymore.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore this is definitively the right decision", Bönte said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since 2009, Klitschko has been with American actress Hayden Panettiere.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have one child, Kaya, born in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="21">Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2008–2012, the two brothers dominated international boxing by holding the titles of different boxing federations at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the weather conditions during this summer season.</seg>

<seg id="4">The wind and cold weather have got Nikkanen down.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unstable conditions are also expected for the World Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.</seg>
<seg id="7">This summer, weather conditions have been against pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I wouldn't like to blame the track, but it's inconceivable that I couldn't even get my shorter poles working properly", Nikkanen said after her competition in Innsbruck.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I've competed and trained here who knows how many times, and I've never seen such changing winds before", Nikkanen said during Paavo Nurmi Games.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This season, it's been very hard to jump steadily, as the winds have been so erratic, even during practice", Nikkanen said at Kalevan Kisat.</seg>
<seg id="11">The weather was also a hot topic in London on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's been a challenge to keep my technique intact. I don't know if it's the cold weather or what.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's been cold and windy, and it has really spoilt the mood.</seg>
<seg id="14">There's no point in consuming energy in bad conditions."</seg>
<seg id="15">She reached the World Championships thanks to jumping 455 indoors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Outdoors, she has reached 445.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conditions are not the same for everyone in London.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is important to stay patient and wait for better winds.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nikkanen's goal is to jump 460 on Friday and make it to the finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Why won't you train abroad?</seg>
<seg id="21">"That's not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="22">Early last season, I trained in Italy and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">I got my technique together and stable.</seg>
<seg id="24">This year, I probably should have done the same.</seg>
<seg id="25">Normally, I've been able to train indoors, but now the facility has been closed."</seg>
<seg id="26">What would be ideal weather conditions to compete in?</seg>
<seg id="27">"The temperature should be 25 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="28">I don't mind low winds, as long as they stay the same."</seg>

<seg id="1">Experienced former government official criticised politicians for Yle: "We have nothing to distribute, now or in many years to come"</seg>
<seg id="2">Erkki Virtanen, an experienced government official who prepared budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades warns that, despite the positive economic atmosphere, the Government of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä must keep its cool and be careful not to increase the state budget with borrowed money.</seg>
<seg id="3">He says that there is nothing to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yle interviewed Virtanen, who retired in 2015, in Ykkösaamu on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The preparation of next year's state budget is about to begin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Virtanen regards the recent proposals of politicians for increasing the standard pension, decreasing car taxes and supporting electric bikes as election rhetoric.</seg>
<seg id="7">They mainly indicate that elections are approaching. After all, as ten per cent of the state budget is funded by borrowing more money, there is nothing to distribute, now or in many years to come.</seg>
<seg id="8">Virtanen told Yle that it is nearly a deception to talk about distributable funds when they are borrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">He emphasised that all money borrowed is something our children have to pay back.</seg>
<seg id="10">Virtanen has a long history in preparing state budgets: he started working in the Ministry of Finance in 1978 as a budget secretary, and worked since as a deputy manager of the budget department and as a budget manager.</seg>
<seg id="11">Before his retirement, he worked as the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the Yle interview, Virtanen pointed out that the estimated economic growth of three per cent will probably be temporary.</seg>
<seg id="13">All economists estimate that his is only a spike, followed by a downward trend next year, and Finland must expect growth of one per cent for decades.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tommi was driving with his spouse and their two small children.</seg>
<seg id="3">Luckily, they did not get hurt in the accident, but they will not receive any insurance compensation, unless the counterparty can be reached.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident took place near Keimolanportti in Vantaa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Archive photo from Ring Road III roadwork site.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tommi from Vantaa says it was a miracle that their family survived the car accident on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tommi, his spouse Riina and their two small children were driving on the highway near Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tommi says that a white car was speeding up on the Ring Road III junction about to enter the highway when it nearly hit the side of their car.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Tommi, the white car would have hit them if Tommi had not been able to swerve to the left.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I hit the brakes and swerved to the left at the same time – and then I lost control of the car", Tommi says.</seg>
<seg id="11">The family's car hit the median barrier at high speed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The parents and their two children sitting in the back seat did not get hurt.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the children is almost three years old, and the other is under 12 months of age.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We were really lucky not to get hurt.</seg>
<seg id="15">There were no cars heading our way, even though the place is usually very busy."</seg>
<seg id="16">The accident took place at 5:20 pm.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Tommi, no car stopped to help them, and the family called 112.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were able to get out of the car without help.</seg>
<seg id="19">An ambulance and rescue personnel arrived on site to check the condition of the family members.</seg>
<seg id="20">The car was damaged beyond repair.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tommi says that he and her spouse have a low income and their respective families chipped in to help them buy the car.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Tommi, they will not receive any insurance compensation, unless they obtain the details of the other car.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why the family hopes that anyone who witnessed the accident come forth and report any information about the other car.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We need a car every single day.</seg>
<seg id="25">We can't take our children to the day-care centre or go to work without it", Tommi says.</seg>
<seg id="26">Tommi saw that the other car was white and a little older,</seg>
<seg id="27">probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="28">He thinks that the registration number started with SIG.</seg>
<seg id="29">"If the counterparty cannot be apprehended, I don't know how we can survive financially – we are already in a situation where we need to count every penny."</seg>
<seg id="30">Tommi hopes that anyone who witnessed the accident or knows something about it contacts the police.</seg>
<seg id="31">Persons contacted from the Itä-Uusimaa police department and the Keski-Uusimaa rescue department confirm that they were at the accident site on Tuesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="32">The headline and article were revised at 9:15 pm: Unlike originally reported, the other car did not drive the other way, but nearly hit the family's car when entering the highway from a junction.</seg>

<seg id="1">Show directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships by means of comedy – Itsensäpaljastelija will be performed at Mikä? Theatre on Friday and Saturday</seg>
<seg id="2">Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first theatre production as a director to the Mikä? Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="3">Itsensäpaljastelija (Exhibitionist) is a musical theatre show about relationships gone bad and insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="4">Director Lotta Jäppinen says that it will still make audiences feel good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The themes are dealt with by means of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="6">We will not wallow in sad emotions", Jäppinen says.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre show has been produced with a small budget, but with a big young heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The name of the show challenges its audiences to think what we expose of ourselves when we meet new people.</seg>
<seg id="9">Do we play a certain role or do we approach others openly?</seg>
<seg id="10">The plotless show is a mix of fact and fiction.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jäppinen has both directed the show and adapted it for the stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is also in charge of lighting.</seg>
<seg id="13">The show consists of texts written by the working group, and there is no plot.</seg>
<seg id="14">The director believes that, even though the show gets its inspiration from young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jäppinen emphasises that Itensäpaljastelija does not express her own relationships or those of the working group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's a mix of fact and fiction.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'm sure my values come through from the show.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm not thinking that human relations are bad, but I don't think either that a relationship, especially an intimate relationship, is the only key to happiness."</seg>
<seg id="19">Many learn from their divorced parents</seg>
<seg id="20">Jäppinen thinks that Itsensäpaljastelija draws a topical picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.</seg>
<seg id="21">She says that many have learned about relationships from their parents, many of whom are divorced –</seg>
<seg id="22">at least that it is important to listen to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is no need to stay in a relationship that does not work.</seg>
<seg id="24">The show is performed by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.</seg>
<seg id="25">Costumier Ella Snellman is also part of the working group.</seg>
<seg id="26">Music has been arranged by Jäppinen and Rokka.</seg>
<seg id="27">Love for the theatre ignited in Kouvola</seg>
<seg id="28">Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola is studying at the Arts Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences to become a director of theatrical performance.</seg>
<seg id="29">After two years, she has reached the halfway point of her studies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Jäppinen fell in love with the theatre during her years in Kouvola.</seg>
<seg id="31">Specialising in music during her school years, she has worked as an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and acted, for example, at Ylioppilasteatteri student theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, at Linnateatteri theatre in Turku.</seg>
<seg id="32">Her interest in directing has increased steadily.</seg>
<seg id="33">Itsensäpaljastelija premiered last week at Narrin näyttämö in Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 45-minute show will most likely be also performed in Turku where Jäppinen is studying.</seg>
<seg id="35">Itsensäpaljastelija at Mikä? Theatre in Kouvola on 4 August at 7 pm and on 5 August at 2 pm and 7 pm.</seg>

<seg id="1">Finnish Olympic winner took one year to recover from a terrible motocross accident – cervical spine fractured</seg>
<seg id="2">Not many Finnish athletes are the unstoppable force of nature that is Janne Lahtela.</seg>
<seg id="3">The star mogul skier travelled around the world hundreds of days for twenty years and chased his dream of winning the Olympic gold medal.</seg>
<seg id="4">The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela kept going.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was not only tireless in training, but also eager to try new sports.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are not many sports above ground Kemijärvi-based Lahtela has not tried at least once.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It has helped me not to stop.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's always something new", Lahtela says.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the end, one sport nearly stopped Lahtela for good.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2014, he was in a motocross accident,</seg>
<seg id="11">where he suffered a cervical fracture and broke both of his arms.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I couldn't work anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="13">I licked my wounds at home for a year", Lahtela says.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was also bad luck involved.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lahtela also admits that his age might have had something to do with the accident.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Riding a motocross bike may seem wild.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I wasn't trying to find any limits.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's just such a tough sport that it's too much for a forty year old like me!"</seg>
<seg id="19">After the accident, Lahtela was in an unusual situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">His active life came to a full stop.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had recently returned from a long stint as the head coach of the national freestyle team of Japan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lahtela started in this position immediately after his career ended in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I had to stay still for the first time since I turned 15.</seg>
<seg id="24">I didn't really do anything", says Lahtela.</seg>
<seg id="25">When he worked as a coach, Lahtela often challenged his athletes in the slopes and physical condition tests.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Surprisingly, having to stop was a positive experience.</seg>
<seg id="27">I was so tired, both mentally and physically, that even my own thoughts didn't seem rational,</seg>
<seg id="28">not even those related to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="29">It felt good to just stop.</seg>
<seg id="30">I actually enjoyed that I didn't have to do anything."</seg>
<seg id="31">The forced break inspired Lahtela to start as the head coach of Team Finland.</seg>
<seg id="32">If he had not had to stop, he might have burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It's easier to find parts of my body that have been broken than those that have remained intact!</seg>
<seg id="34">Without the accident, I wouldn't have realised that I needed so much rest."</seg>
<seg id="35">Lahtela started as the head coach of the national freestyle team of Finland a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace high-speed sports.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I replaced motocross with disc golf!</seg>
<seg id="38">It all got out of hand right away.</seg>
<seg id="39">At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing."</seg>
<seg id="40">Even though Lahtela has always worked hard, he does not demand similar commitment from his athletes.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I don't want to force everyone to be the same.</seg>
<seg id="42">In our culture, there is room to be yourself and there are many ways to become the best in the world.</seg>
<seg id="43">As indicated by its name, freestyle has always been about a free style and mentality," Lahtela says.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned</seg>
<seg id="2">Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yep.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sex robots are a big deal right now.</seg>
<seg id="5">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.</seg>
<seg id="8">"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also has moods during the day just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="18">She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"</seg>
<seg id="19">There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.</seg>
<seg id="20">On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.</seg>
<seg id="26">And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.</seg>
<seg id="30">The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="33">They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.</seg>
<seg id="35">They are pleasant slaves, in other words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.</seg>

<seg id="4">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="7">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="14">I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="16">While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="17">The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.</seg>
<seg id="18">So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="25">The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD</seg>
<seg id="2">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="5">While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'</seg>
<seg id="13">He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.</seg>
<seg id="15">She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="16">The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="25">Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands</seg>
<seg id="2">The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.</seg>
<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Prosecutor General of Venezuela has applied for a court order to prevent the new delegates from being appointed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela, has announced that the new delegates elected through last Sunday's elections will be appointed on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result of the controversial elections, Venezuela received new delegates who are authorised, for example, to amend the nation's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Prosecutor General Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent the appointment was demanded due to suspicions that the elections were rigged.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ortega has also launched investigations for the allegedly rigged elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">She appointed two judges after the British company that organised the elections announced that the results had been manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan officials is higher than the number of actual voters by approximately one million.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only Maduro's allies ran for the constituent assembly, and the 545 delegates elected include, for example, Maduro's wife and son.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to amending the constitution, the delegates are authorised to dissolve the opposition-led congress and amend laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">Maduro described as a dictator</seg>
<seg id="12">Maduro's actions have been criticised extensively.</seg>
<seg id="13">The opposition regards the attempts to amend the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.</seg>
<seg id="15">The EU, the UK, Mexico, Columbia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new delegates.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maduro claims that the new delegates offer a solution for the country's political and financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian man extradited from Finland was sentenced to four years of imprisonment in the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, the District Court of Minneapolis in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senakh to nearly four years of imprisonment for his involvement in a global computer fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senakh was apprehended in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a claim issued by the USA.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senakh was on holiday in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Finnish border authorities apprehended him when he was returning home.</seg>
<seg id="6">AFP reports that Finland extradited Senakh to the US criminal justice authorities in February 2016, regardless of the objections of the Russians.</seg>
<seg id="7">In March, he was found guilty of a computer fraud to generate millions of dollars in profits.</seg>
<seg id="8">Senakh was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the US Department of Justice, Senakh will be expelled once he has served his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Finland harshly after the apprehension and stated that Senakh must not be extradited to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its statement, it criticised Finland and the USA for apprehending the man in Finland without notifying Russia of the situation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the prosecutor's office, Senakh had used a computer virus called Ebury to infect tens of thousands of computers around the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">The virus was then used to phish usernames and passwords.</seg>
<seg id="14">Next, the perpetrators used these to reroute internet traffic to commit click frauds and spread junk mail.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, this case indicates that the USA is also able to chase cybercriminals operating in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have the ability and will to identify and track them, and to bring them to justice", Blanco stated in his statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flood of certain types of tourists threatens local culture</seg>
<seg id="2">The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="3">The local population is particularly enraged by tourists travelling on cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism calls this "eat and flee" tourism: travellers spend a few hours at a destination, running through the major attractions as a large group.</seg>
<seg id="5">Venice is suffocating under travellers popping in the city for a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is difficult to move around in narrow streets and beautiful squares are packed with tourists, leaving no room for those who live in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are forced to move farther away from the historic centre, while homes have been replaced by hotels.</seg>
<seg id="8">The problems presented by tourism in Venice are reported by The New York Times and The Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="9">The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists.</seg>
<seg id="10">They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.</seg>
<seg id="11">"When a large ocean liner arrives at port, you have two to three hours to see the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">You follow a flag-holding guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco and then turn back", says Dario Franceschini, the Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism, describing the current problematic form of tourism.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The beauty of Italian cities does not lie only in architecture, but also in their location, stores and workshops.</seg>
<seg id="14">We need to be able to preserve this part of the identity of our cities."</seg>
<seg id="15">Piazza San Marco is one of the most popular attractions in the historic centre of Venice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Saint Mark's Basilica is located by the piazza.</seg>
<seg id="17">The local population is mainly angered by cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="18">The historic centre of Venice only has a local population of 50,000.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1951, its population was 175,000.</seg>
<seg id="20">In July, roughly 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to them, tourism reduces their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives out the local population.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Some 2,000 people move out every year.</seg>
<seg id="23">If the same continues, there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="24">This would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster", says Carlo Belframe, one of the organisers of the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a difficult situation, as cruise ships provide Venice with badly-needed funds and jobs in various fields.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition to limiting the number of tourists, one solution would be if cruise ships moored farther away from the historic centre.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to Luciano Bortot who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Veneto, the administrative region where Venice is located, had more power to decide on its own affairs, or became fully autonomous even.</seg>
<seg id="28">Every year, Venice is visited by 20 to 30 million tourists.</seg>

<seg id="1">I get along fine without such attention</seg>
<seg id="2">The 23-year-old runner has witnessed the downsides of being in the public eye.</seg>
<seg id="3">Amalie Iuel has published spectacular photos of herself in such places as the Grand Canyon.</seg>
<seg id="4">Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a highly popular athlete in her current home country Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in 400 metres by crossing the line at 51.81.</seg>
<seg id="5">A month later she broke the Norwegian record in 400 metres hurdles by running 55.38.</seg>
<seg id="6">A frequent user of social media, Iuel noticed, soon after breaking the records, that there are downsides to being famous and in the public eye.</seg>
<seg id="7">Men from all parts of the world started to send her photos of their genitals in the hope of catching the attention of the young hurdler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Iuel was forced to make her Snapchat account private.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I received numerous obscene photos from people I don't know, and I had to make my account private", Iuel said to VG.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her interview for VG, Iuel did not want to go into details regarding the photos she has received.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You can probably guess", Iuel said laughing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's nice to get feedback after my run, but I can get along nicely without the other kind of attention."</seg>
<seg id="13">Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her mother is Danish and his father is Danish-Norwegian.</seg>
<seg id="15">Iuel's family moved to Norway when she was two years old.</seg>
<seg id="16">When Amalie was 12, the family first moved to Namibia and then to Pakistan because of her father's work.</seg>
<seg id="17">These were followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="18">Iuel trained four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from where she returned to Norway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Foot injury threatened the whole career of snowboarder Janne Korpi – now ready to race in the World Championships: "It's nice when nothing hurts"</seg>
<seg id="2">It's been fun to snowboard when nothing hurts!</seg>
<seg id="3">Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has once again been able to enjoy the sport he loves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last summer, his whole career was at risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">A repetitive strain injury to Korpi's foot required surgery in January, and the foot took its time healing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Korpi's has also hurt his arm when racing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In summer, I had no idea whether or not I would be able to continue my career.</seg>
<seg id="8">My sponsorship deals ended and many things remained undecided", Korpi says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But so they say that everything will be alright in the end.</seg>
<seg id="10">My foot got better, my sponsor extended our deal by two years and I wanted to get back on the slopes.</seg>
<seg id="11">After all this, it was an easy decision to continue my career.</seg>
<seg id="12">I knew it when I hit the slopes again.</seg>
<seg id="13">I thought that, damn, this sure is fun, let's continue for a couple of seasons."</seg>
<seg id="14">Korpi was able to ride properly in September and October, but being able to train without any pain after a long break was a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Korpi has only raced a few times,</seg>
<seg id="16">but that is OK.</seg>
<seg id="17">Races have never been that important in snowboarding for Korpi.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I've never snowboarded for the sake of any single competition.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's frustrating to train four years for a single competition, only to fall ill just before.</seg>
<seg id="20">I don't have that mindset", Korpi says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Today, Korpi will be racing in the halfpipe event of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even though individual competitions are not what attract Korpi in snowboarding, he is always fired up and ready to race.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Korpi, competitions held by the International Ski Federation (FIS) have become more widely accepted in recent years, even though some snowboarders chose to take part in the X-Games that are held at the same time in Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">"These are big races with a lot of exposure round the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">Then again, I think that acceptance always depends on the conditions and level of each competition."</seg>
<seg id="26">Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-athlete Team Finland competing in Sierra Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="27">The youngest members of the team, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpi.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's fun to watch the younger riders.</seg>
<seg id="29">I remember when I was that young that everything was new and I was insanely excited about everything.</seg>
<seg id="30">This also gives me energy", Korpi says.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I can just about keep up with them on the slopes, but nowhere else; they are so full of energy!"</seg>
<seg id="32">Alongside his snowboarding career, Janne Korpi has also been building another career in sports.</seg>
<seg id="33">The son of legendary harness racer Pekka Korpi is a fan of harness racing: he has his own racehorses that he prepares training plans for.</seg>
<seg id="34">"When I'm travelling all the time, there's no time to be more involved.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, I try to at least check the race results every day, even watch some races as well", Korpi says.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Korpi, harness racing and coaching offer a potential career plan when his snowboarding career eventually ends.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I don't want to look that far ahead, but it's a possible option.</seg>
<seg id="38">It feels like I'm studying it alongside snowboarding.</seg>
<seg id="39">I try to stay on top of things and improve myself, maybe even take part in a few races in summer.</seg>
<seg id="40">If that becomes my future profession, it won't be that hard to start if I already know a thing or two."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Elitloppet cruise hosted together with Jaajo Linnonmaa is also part of harness racing.</seg>
<seg id="42">The two have leased a cruise ship for the Elitloppet event in Stockholm at the end of May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to bring the age-old tradition back to life.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We've already sold heaps of cruise tickets, and there’s been plenty of excitement about the event.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now we are at the point where at least we cannot go bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are still a few months to go, and we hope that we have a ship full of people", Korpi says enthusiastically.</seg>

<seg id="2">Attendo Esteri is the name of the new nursing home to be built in Kitee. It will have room for 41 elderly clients.</seg>
<seg id="3">The over 1,700 m2 building will be completed next summer across the healthcare centre on Terveystie.</seg>
<seg id="4">People in Kitee are wondering from where the new nursing home intends to get its clients, as the social and healthcare service reform has caused a shortage of clients at many private nursing homes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Anne Flink, regional director of nursing services at Attendo, said that Kitee will have demand not only for optional services, but also for service housing with 24-hour assistance.</seg>
<seg id="6">"All kinds of services are needed and, when there are options, people also have the freedom of choice", Flink says.</seg>

<seg id="2">A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="3">GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.</seg>
<seg id="5">McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="1">Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>

<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="1">NYT: Calls praised by Trump were phony – White House press secretary: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"</seg>
<seg id="2">The New York Times reports that the White House admits that the two calls mentioned by President Donald Trump never happened.</seg>
<seg id="3">The calls with the President of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scouts praised by Trump turned out to be fabrications.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, confirmed that neither one of the calls took place.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, she said that Trump did not lie.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Sanders, many leaders of the Boy Scouts talked with Trump in person, and Trump had a conversation with Enrique Peña Nieto, the President of Mexico, at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I wouldn't say it was a lie – that's a pretty bold accusation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The conversations took place, they just simply didn't take place over a phone call, they happened in person", Sanders said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speech to Boy Scouts raised criticism</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, Trump told that the President of Mexico called him and congratulated Trump for his success in reducing illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Trump, Peña Nieto said that not many cross the southern border because they know that they will be stopped at the US borderline.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Wednesday, the Mexican Government issued a statement, saying that this phone call never took place.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with the Wall Street Journal</seg>
<seg id="14">where Trump praised his speech at the National Scout Jamboree in West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I got a call from the leader of Boy Scouts who said that it was the best speech that was ever made to them,</seg>
<seg id="16">and they were very thankful", Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts of America announced that they do not have any information about any of their leaders placing a call to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the announcement, the previous statement of Michael Surbaugh, the Chief Scout Executive, in which he apologised to all members of the organisation for Trump's speech speaks for itself.</seg>
<seg id="19">Trump's speech at the National Scout Jamboree aroused astonishment, as it was unusually political considering the nature of the event.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.</seg>
