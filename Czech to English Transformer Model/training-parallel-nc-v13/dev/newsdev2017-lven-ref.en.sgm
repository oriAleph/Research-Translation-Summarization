<seg id="1">New Questions Over California Water Project</seg>
<seg id="2">Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California.</seg>
<seg id="4">The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's a shell game," said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director.</seg>
<seg id="9">I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California.</seg>
<seg id="11">Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there.</seg>
<seg id="13">Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="14">The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, "the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources."</seg>
<seg id="16">After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, "This is to be expected" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district.</seg>
<seg id="17">He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="18">Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="21">It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Business Groups Appeal to China Over Cybersecurity Law</seg>
<seg id="2">A coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">The letter to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products.</seg>
<seg id="4">Signers include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="5">The proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tianjin chemical blast: Deadly disaster marked one year on</seg>
<seg id="2">Zhang Mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the Tianjin blasts</seg>
<seg id="3">China's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.</seg>
<seg id="4">John Sudworth reports from Tianjin.</seg>
<seg id="5">Almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching.</seg>
<seg id="6">But not in China.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of Tianjin, elsewhere the tributes are being muted.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Communist Party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors, as well as family members of the dead, are being warned not to speak to the foreign press.</seg>
<seg id="9">But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan won't stay quiet.</seg>
<seg id="10">"On this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened," he tells me.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't want silence.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 August last year, Mr Zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade, stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The call came in at 10:53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot.</seg>
<seg id="16">All of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored, way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.</seg>
<seg id="18">It then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.</seg>
<seg id="19">The resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those reports never came in.</seg>
<seg id="21">"When I saw the mushroom cloud I fell into a state of desperation," he tells me.</seg>
<seg id="22">I knew what it would mean for my friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night, eight never came back.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event, with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away.</seg>
<seg id="26">The total cost of the damage was put at more than $1bn, including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">A total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Eight bodies have never been found.</seg>
<seg id="29">An official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption, political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden.</seg>
<seg id="30">The storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="32">So while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain.</seg>
<seg id="33">The disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero, there is the other uncomfortable picture.</seg>
<seg id="35">That of the firefighter as victim, sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable, man-made catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="36">Zhang Mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.</seg>
<seg id="37">He will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades.</seg>
<seg id="38">What I want to tell them most is this: I've been to visit your parents and they are fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">Leave your parents to me.</seg>
<seg id="40">I am a member of your family now.</seg>
<seg id="41">I will fulfil your filial duty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's grouse shooting season will begin later, with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the Edinburgh festivals.</seg>
<seg id="5">But animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the "brutal slaughter" of the birds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The organisation's director Harry Huyton said: "The effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel, unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="8">But landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The SGA's chairman, Alex Hogg, said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a "rich seam of employment" in uncertain times.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said: "Compared to many other European countries, Scotland does not have an embedded 'hunting' culture and chunks of the population don't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country, economically."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe, Tattoo and Hogmanay combined.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added: "There are real concerns for employment in rural Scotland at the moment, particularly in oil and gas, so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to work with the Scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.</seg>
<seg id="14">RSPB Scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors</seg>
<seg id="15">Many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the SGA said the industry had made "significant strides in terms of best practice."</seg>
<seg id="16">The opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the "Glorious Twelfth."</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms Cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags, to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Scottish Moorland Group accused the RSPB of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the Monadhliath area.</seg>

<seg id="2">Aaron McEneff netted two first-half penalties for the visitors at Finn Park</seg>
<seg id="3">Derry City have moved up to second in the Premier Division thanks to a thumping 5-0 derby win over Finn Harps.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aaron McEneff put the Candystripes in control with two first-half penalties, both given for fouls on Lukas Schubert.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nathan Boyle fired home early in the second half and Schubert hammered in the fourth before Keith Ward's late lob completed the Finn Park rout.</seg>
<seg id="6">Derry go a point ahead of Cork City and the teams meet at the Brandywell on Monday night in a crunch encounter.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was Derry's first win over their north-west rivals in three meetings this season and they were rarely troubled by a disappointing Harps side.</seg>
<seg id="8">McEneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after Ciaran Coll's challenge on Schubert, although the foul appeared to be outside the box.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no doubt the second spot-kick, with former Candystripes midfielder Barry Molloy bringing downing Schubert and McEneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boyle produced a clinical finish from a Dean Jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="11">City keeper Gerard Doherty had a quiet night but he made a fine save to deny David Scully in the host's best opening of the game.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schubert flicked the ball past Coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by Ward's clever chip over Harps stopper Richard Brush.</seg>

<seg id="1">Probe after mass failure of Inverness College UHI course</seg>
<seg id="2">An entire class of 20 students may have failed a Higher Media course run by Inverness College UHI.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inverness College UHI said quality assurance processes were in place, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) was investigating.</seg>
<seg id="5">A spokesman for the SQA said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had "performed as intended."</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty students signed up for the Inverness College UHI-run and marked course.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online, but also had to make frequent visits to the college in Inverness from where they lived in places such as Lochaber.</seg>
<seg id="8">A father of one of the students said that, following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work.</seg>
<seg id="9">He told BBC News Scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at Inverness College UHI last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="10">The situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school.</seg>
<seg id="11">But her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now "in limbo" and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places.</seg>
<seg id="12">Inverness College UHI is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.</seg>
<seg id="13">Diane Rawlinson, principal and chief executive at Inverness College UHI, said: "We take exam results and student success very seriously."</seg>
<seg id="14">This is evidenced by the excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both Further and Higher education.</seg>
<seg id="15">As we do every year, we are undertaking a review of all published results, comparing them against those projected for each student.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the case of this particular course, the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported 'significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award' and confirmed that 'assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set'.</seg>
<seg id="17">SQA are currently investigating this matter at our request.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the SQA said: "We are happy that the 2016 Higher Media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the A-C attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jason Bryden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife and nunchucks</seg>
<seg id="3">Two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drugs-related robbery in East Ayrshire turned into a "bloodbath."</seg>
<seg id="4">The victim, Jason Bryden, 38, was repeatedly stabbed during the attack at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.</seg>
<seg id="6">His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out "a merciless, relentless and savage attack."</seg>
<seg id="8">He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.</seg>
<seg id="9">Judge Dunlop added: "You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jason Bryden may have been a drug dealer but he was a son, a father and a friend.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was butchered by you.</seg>
<seg id="12">After both men were jailed, Det Insp David Moran, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark caused the death of Jason Bryden."</seg>
<seg id="13">To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.</seg>
<seg id="16">The sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neighbours said they could see the Clarks attacking Mr Bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the trial: "This was a sustained, frenzied attack on this man."</seg>
<seg id="19">Afterwards, the scene of the killing was described as a "bloodbath."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to the stab wounds, Mr Bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault.</seg>
<seg id="21">He died in Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital three days later.</seg>
<seg id="22">Both brothers denied the killing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In evidence, James Clark, who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder, said: "I didn't mean it. It was an accident."</seg>
<seg id="24">John Clark, who has 23 previous convictions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by Mr Bryden.</seg>

<seg id="2">David Sinclair admitted killing the child at his home in East Kilbride in 2012</seg>
<seg id="3">A man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of rage because he would not feed has been jailed for seven years and three months.</seg>
<seg id="4">David Sinclair shook four-month-old Joshua in a "momentary loss of control" at their home in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on 6 December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical experts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sinclair, 34, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bracadale told Sinclair: "You assaulted your baby son by shaking him, causing the injuries which killed him."</seg>
<seg id="8">You must have known at the time you had shaken him, but you did not disclose that.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was only after extensive medical investigations you admitted what you had done.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your wife believed in you.</seg>
<seg id="11">She now feels she had been misled by you and can no longer support you.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lord Bracadale described the effects of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for all concerned and added: "Nothing can bring Joshua back."</seg>
<seg id="13">The court previously heard that that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his wife Kirsty had gone swimming with Joshua and then shopping in East Kilbride.</seg>
<seg id="14">At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded "shocked."</seg>
<seg id="16">He told her: "Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away."</seg>
<seg id="17">He then hung up and dialled 999.</seg>
<seg id="18">The infant was rushed to Hairmyres Hospital where he died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally, close to the time of death.</seg>
<seg id="20">One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: "This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="21">Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair was "extremely remorseful" for his actions.</seg>

<seg id="2">GB's Tutton misses 200m breaststroke bronze</seg>
<seg id="3">Great Britain's Chloe Tutton appeared to criticise controversial swimmer Yulia Efimova's presence in Rio after the Russian finished ahead of her in the 200m breaststroke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Efimova, who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban, took silver with Tutton fourth.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I would've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games," the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer said afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="6">I couldn't help who was here.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm not happy with it, but that's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="8">Efimova in second place didn't even know she was in the games until three days ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">I don't want to see people taken out of the sport, but I don't think that's quite right.</seg>
<seg id="10">She shouldn't have been in the race and a 20-year-old from Britain should have had a medal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at Rio 2016 to beat Efimova into silver.</seg>
<seg id="12">China's Jinglin Shi won bronze, just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed Tutton.</seg>
<seg id="13">Her British team-mate Molly Renshaw, 20, finished sixth.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Being fourth is a bit gutting, no matter who is in front of you," Tutton added.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a great experience and I'm a bit disappointed to come fourth.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">But just to get into the final is a great experience that I'll take on with me for years to come.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time I'll get closer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tutton finished just 0.01 seconds outside the British record in the women's 200m breaststroke final</seg>
<seg id="20">'Everyone should have a second chance' - Efimova</seg>
<seg id="21">Efimova, who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to compete at Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">She was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Your delegation is pushy and rude</seg>
<seg id="2">India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a conspicuous presence at Rio's Olympic Games, frequently spotted in the stands cheering on Indian athletes and taking selfies after their events.</seg>
<seg id="3">But he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of Olympic officials with unruly behavior, repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked, the Press Trust of India reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vijay Goel, pictured in July, has defended his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if the behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals," Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee wrote in the note.</seg>
<seg id="7">When the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior, the accreditation of your Minister for Sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the Olympic Games withdrawn," the letter continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Indian delegation called the matter "a non-issue being made an issue" and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, chalking it up to a "misunderstanding."</seg>
<seg id="10">He tweeted, "To my knowledge, we have been following all rules & regulations.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are committed to the spirit of Olympics & back our Indian players.</seg>
<seg id="12">Otherwise it's been a gloomy Olympics for India, with zero medals so far.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bummed-out fans on social media noted that Michael Phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as India has won in its history.</seg>
<seg id="14">Several prominent contenders have already been eliminated, including shooter Abhinav Bindra who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="15">He placed fourth this time.</seg>
<seg id="16">What a waste of money and opportunity," author and columnist Shobhaa De said in a sardonic tweet.</seg>
<seg id="17">But some bright hopes remain, with competitors foraging ahead in boxing, golf, tennis, track and field and, yes, badminton.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lone Indian woman gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the vault finals on Sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution "Vault of Death," the Produnova, attempted by few other gymnasts.</seg>
<seg id="19">For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low medal count has always been a source of consternation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national obsession is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="22">India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for Olympians - Karmakar's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parents have historically emphasized academics over sport.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the sports' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption.</seg>
<seg id="25">The International Olympic Committee suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Sochi, India's three winter Olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country, carry the flag or wear the insignia.</seg>
<seg id="27">They competed as independents.</seg>

<seg id="1">DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana</seg>
<seg id="2">The answer sadly is: unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="3">And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Up until today, there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana, at the University of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door.</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.</seg>
<seg id="10">Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is the predicament of medical marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="17">This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, after years of bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock.</seg>
<seg id="20">Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.</seg>
<seg id="22">The problem, however, is that last word in its name: "abuse."</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine.</seg>
<seg id="24">Abrams makes an important point.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits.</seg>
<seg id="28">The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="29">That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture.</seg>
<seg id="30">The road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.</seg>
<seg id="31">While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.</seg>
<seg id="33">In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.</seg>
<seg id="34">For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.</seg>
<seg id="35">By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.</seg>
<seg id="36">Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.</seg>
<seg id="37">By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="38">Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself.</seg>
<seg id="39">And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.</seg>
<seg id="40">Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives.</seg>
<seg id="41">Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.</seg>
<seg id="42">With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="44">That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Bloody Beetroots is known for electronic dance music</seg>
<seg id="3">The musicians say Trump's dominance of the media is similar to Berlusconi's</seg>
<seg id="4">"You know, we used to have Berlusconi in Italy and to me, Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi," Rifo, who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Republican presidential nominee and the Italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities, their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bech in the 2013 song, "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."</seg>
<seg id="7">Rifo was born in the Italian town of Bessano del Grappa outside Venice in 1977, which is around the time punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" are tattooed across the musician's chest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"English is not my main language so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said from behind a black mask, which he is known for.</seg>
<seg id="9">I try to explore and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rifo urged Americans to watch "Videocracy," a documentary which explores Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The documentary is about "how Berlusconi used to drive Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump has had a similar effect on America.</seg>
<seg id="12">"You see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump, to me, looks like something that is not good for this country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million drugs bust</seg>
<seg id="2">Two Turkish men convicted of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of the Class A drug were discovered inside the MV Hamal about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal</seg>
<seg id="6">The massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history</seg>
<seg id="7">The drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the Tanzanian-registered tugboat, which was sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter HMC Valiant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sahin, 47, was sentenced to 22 years while Ozmen, 51, was handed down a 20-year term at the High Court in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="10">Judge Lord Kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was 'not only significant but massive' and drugs trafficking had a 'devastating impact' on people and communities.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said: 'You were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship, in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries.'</seg>
<seg id="12">He told the ship's captain Sahin, he was 'not at the top of the drugs tree' but had played an important role in the offence, while second captain Ozmen's role was 'to some extent a lesser one'.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officers boarded the Hamal following a tip-off from French customs body DNRED, and once it was docked in Aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, with an estimated street value of £512 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">MV Hamal was boarded by the Royal Navy last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Three tonnes of cocaine was onboard</seg>
<seg id="16">Tonnes of the Class-A drug were crammed in the ship's ballast tank when it was raided</seg>
<seg id="17">The ship went from the Bosporus to South America before being stopped in the North Sea</seg>
<seg id="18">The entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew's quarters, with the opening cemented over.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between April 21 and April 23.</seg>
<seg id="20">The men, both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school, continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury's verdict.</seg>
<seg id="21">Charges against four other men were found not proven.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said the married father-of-two was a 'glorified mule'.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said: 'Someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Someone who was able to captain a boat.</seg>
<seg id="25">In regard to the drugs hierarchy, Mr Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down.</seg>
<seg id="26">The sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane</seg>
<seg id="27">Police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes</seg>
<seg id="28">Sahin was approached about captaining the Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr Crowe said he is 'devastated' about missing out on milestones for his daughter, nine, and son, 13, and 'just wants to go home to Turkey'.</seg>
<seg id="30">Both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in April 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ozmen's lawyer, Di Moore, said he is 'desperate' to see his family but knows that will 'remain impossible' for the foreseeable future.</seg>
<seg id="32">Speaking following today's sentencing, Scotland's Crown Agent prosecutor David Harvie said: 'The international drugs trade does not respect borders, and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Scotland's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals.'</seg>
<seg id="34">Drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat, including under the floors</seg>
<seg id="35">This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by officers</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr Harvie added:'The Hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from French authorities, and swift co-operation from the Attorney General in Tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded.</seg>
<seg id="37">'Our investigation then stretched from Guyana, who provided access to crucial shipping records, to Spain, who gave us crucial information on the ship's stop-offs in the Canary Islands.</seg>
<seg id="38">We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite strong intelligence that the Hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs, it could not be boarded in international waters by the UK authorities without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Sue Patten, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: 'Acting quickly and precisely, the CPS criminal justice adviser in Tanzania was able get permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="41">Under international maritime law, the UK cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser, there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lancashire father banned from children's school after wearing T-shirt with swear word</seg>
<seg id="2">A father-of-two has been banned from his children's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive T-shirt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley, in Lancashire, says he 'accidentally' wore the top with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it'.</seg>
<seg id="4">But despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the T-shirt inside out, the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds.</seg>
<seg id="5">The single father, who had been a governor for four years at Park Primary School, in Colne, Burnley, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police.</seg>
<seg id="6">Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive T-shirt to his children's sports day</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Burnley has accused head teacher Sarah Midgely of overreacting.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the T-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dad, who has now quit as a school governor, said: "It was a mistake, and an oversight on my part.</seg>
<seg id="10">I was not thinking about sports day and rushing when I put it on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Towards the end of the event we were having a father's race and the head teacher noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="12">I apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already apologised.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The headteacher then phoned me and said I was barred from the school premises," added Mr Burnley,</seg>
<seg id="15">I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested.</seg>
<seg id="16">Any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr McBeth, who is the editor of an online magazine called Love Mini, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term, because of the ban.</seg>
<seg id="18">But this prompted a phone call from the school and social services.</seg>
<seg id="19">The t-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles's character Lister from the cult BBC comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic lines -'Let's go out and t**t it.'</seg>
<seg id="20">He commented: "I told them I was not there because they had banned me from the school.</seg>
<seg id="21">I then got a phone call from social services asking why I had not picked my daughter up.</seg>
<seg id="22">The school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr McBeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="24">He says he was also warned he could face a fine of £500 if found trespassing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said this matter is now closed</seg>
<seg id="26">Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr McBeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school.</seg>
<seg id="27">This matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in September.</seg>
<seg id="28">Burnley councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Councillor Jonathan Nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Nixon added: "He was stupid to wear the T-shirt and he apologised at the time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Lancashire Police confirmed they were called by the school, but did not attend.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ombudsman: Doubletalk over mandatory health insurance model with an additional financial burden on citizens brings no good at all.</seg>
<seg id="2">Any doubletalk over mandatory health insurance, which would impose a direct and considerable payment burden on citizens, brings no good at all, considers the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jansons, today met with the minister of health Anda Čakša to discuss the situation in the health sector.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the meeting, Jansons told reporters that the health minister's proposed funding model is sustainable and would develop the health care system to make it more patient-accessible.</seg>
<seg id="5">He noted that in this case it is necessary to talk about additional funding for health care, which is currently insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jansons also highlighted that any doubletalk over mandatory health insurance, which would impose a direct and sizeable payment burden on citizens, brings no good at all, especially if it quotes the Dutch model.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jansons said that the Netherlands devotes 11% of the gross domestic product to their health care system, while Latvia - only 3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">So the Government and the Parliament should be responsible enough to understand that one should move on from the freezing point, said the Ombudsman and added that, otherwise, the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.</seg>
<seg id="9">Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and noted that the main concern is that patients need to be able to see a doctor, which in turn means that the health care system needs additional funding.</seg>
<seg id="10">While the minister pointed out that with the planned additional 35 million euros next year it will be possible to carry out only the most urgent things concerning oncology patients and obstetricians salaries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, VM has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional 41 million euro allocation to health care, to reduce queues to specialists and to examinations.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's a matter of priorities, whether we have the funds or not," said Čakša.</seg>
<seg id="13">This amount does not include the increase in doctor's salaries.</seg>
<seg id="14">Commenting on the fact that doctors are not enthusiastic about VM bringing to the government all three options of the health care financing model, including the one requiring additional payment from patients, Čakša said that by pushing through all three models, the government has the possibility to choose.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jansons also added that by pushing through all three models, it is possible to clearly show that Latvia is not ready for the additional burden on citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">As reported, VM will defend the health care financing model which does not increase the overall tax burden, however, calls for diverting part of the social tax to health, according to the summary of the conceptional report "Change of the Latvian health care system financing model."</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time the ministry stated that the best health care financing model will be selected as a result of discussions by the end of September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Liepaja theatre starts their guest performances in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="2">On August 12th and 13th, Liepaja Theatre will visit Riga City Theatre, offering viewers both the "Spēlmaņu nakts" (Latvian theatre awards) nominated performances, and fresh intrigue - Liepaja theatre director Herbert Lauksteina's solo performance, as representatives of the theatre have informed the portal "Delfi".</seg>
<seg id="3">On the evening of August 12th, the audience will be shown the drama "The Elephant Man" staged by director Laura Groza-Kibere.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's the story of a real historical person - John Merrick - an inhabitant of Victorian London who due to his congenital disease deformed crippled body, was nicknamed the Elephant Man.</seg>
<seg id="5">The title role is played by the actor Egons Dombrovskis, who for his performance in the the role of Merrick received the "Spēlmaņu nakts" nomination for "Actor of the year".</seg>
<seg id="6">As the critic Normunds Akots described the performance, Merrick is a ""heart-skipping" role, the kind of performance that can not be repeated".</seg>
<seg id="7">On August 13th, viewers will be presented a staging of "Portraits".</seg>
<seg id="8">The performance received six "Spēlmaņu nakts" nominations, including "The largest performance of the year".</seg>
<seg id="9">Directors created a kind of portrait gallery performance, with equal weight given to all roles, so that each of them is both at the centre and forms the backdrop.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is as if the play consists of many mini performances, which at the end merge into a whole.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between real emotion and cold-blooded calculation, brilliantly revealing how people change in various situations - each of the characters is sometimes a wolf who is greedy for their own gain, attacking the people around them, sometimes a sheep that is eaten by someone else.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the Small hall on both of these dates will be played Liepaja theater director Herbert Laukstein's solo performance "The man who shuns the lift" with Galina Polishchuk directing.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not necessarily a sad but a humorous story about how one mans only friend turns into a lift.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the cemetery theme, which dominates the show's visual imagery, the dominant mood of the performance is, however, bright and even optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The man who shuns the lift" is not about loneliness and the fatality of old age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even if it seems, as if it's not about anything" wrote the critic Liga Ulberte about the show.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tickets for all performances can be purchased at "Biļešu paradīzes" offices and on the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detective Olga: my life is not a TV series, it's real life.</seg>
<seg id="2">Olga Zelika is already waiting for me- the owner and investigator of the "Riga Detective Agency".</seg>
<seg id="3">She laughs loudly and gives the impression of being a very positive person.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dressed in white trousers and a white jacket - a very elegant woman who overturns all my preconceptions about what a woman-detective should be.</seg>
<seg id="5">She is waiting for me with champagne, which I kindly refuse.</seg>
<seg id="6">I told her, that I had come to talk to her, because I found it interesting to see a woman doing such an unusual job.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has always seemed to me like a man's work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Olga has a higher legal education - a Master's degree</seg>
<seg id="9">At one time she worked in the criminal police.</seg>
<seg id="10">She realised that she wanted something of her own, and founded her own company.</seg>
<seg id="11">She had acquired enough knowledge to do so.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I really did not want to go back to the police", says Olga.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have a routine.</seg>
<seg id="14">There, in the Criminal Police, we researched cases, gathering information.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were working with suspects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This year we are celebrating the ten year anniversary of "Riga Detective Agency''.</seg>
<seg id="17">She invites me to the anniversary celebrations: "There won't be any drinking."</seg>
<seg id="18">There will only be decent people there.</seg>
<seg id="19">Asked about her business, Olga says: "This kind of business is very specific."</seg>
<seg id="20">The first five years I had team.</seg>
<seg id="21">Then I came to understand, that it's sometimes dangerous to work in a team.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is a business, where if there is anybody who isn't working in a professional manner, you can get into a very bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">If journalists are the fifth power, then we are the second.</seg>
<seg id="24">The situation is not completely straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many people have tried to shut us down, because they were cheating on their spouses.</seg>
<seg id="26">As if people thought they could do that!</seg>
<seg id="27">Many people come and ask, if we can attach listening devices, which will attract dogs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many have seen films.</seg>
<seg id="29">The detective business is a serious one.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's information collection", says Olga.</seg>
<seg id="31">If according to the law a crime has taken place, I must notify the police.</seg>
<seg id="32">We drink our green tea and laugh - it's good to have a drink, and chat about things.</seg>
<seg id="33">I had a client, whose husbands constantly beat her.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of course, she was looking for protection.</seg>
<seg id="35">We also have security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her husband was a maniac.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the beginning, everything was all well and good, but then it began.</seg>
<seg id="38">"That was the worst one", Olga says.</seg>
<seg id="39">The psyche is broken, and you are treated like an animal.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can all end badly.</seg>
<seg id="41">God forbid, with suicides.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is very serious.</seg>
<seg id="43">At some point, people turn into victims.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Many women try to get away from their family but then go back", she says.</seg>
<seg id="45">I refused the last order.</seg>
<seg id="46">"That was the first time in my life", reveals Olga.</seg>
<seg id="47">There was some kind of strange situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The woman was married, she had a son.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Her husband beat her son and turned him into an invalid," Olga recalled.</seg>
<seg id="50">I believe that a woman has a maternal instinct, and must protect their children before anything else.</seg>
<seg id="51">When it all happened, she came to me asking to help her get free from that man.</seg>
<seg id="52">There are people who are obsessed with revenge.</seg>
<seg id="53">The worst thing is that the mother turned a blind eye to it.</seg>
<seg id="54">I can not understand this.</seg>
<seg id="55">Her child is now disabled.</seg>
<seg id="56">Once we could not find a corpse, and the dog was very helpful.</seg>
<seg id="57">When it comes to drugs, we would not get anywhere without the dogs.</seg>
<seg id="58">"To my understanding, there are normal people, and then there are those, who are not mentally well", she says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Of course, there are always cases of cheating.</seg>
<seg id="60">Or a family breaks up, and we must collect information.</seg>
<seg id="61">It needs to be established, which is the guilty party.</seg>
<seg id="62">The latest theme I've come across is that of girlfriends cheating on other girlfriends.</seg>
<seg id="63">It's interesting, because it used to be men that got jealous, now it's women.</seg>
<seg id="64">Even the best of friends have fights!</seg>
<seg id="65">Some women steal 100 or more thousand euros from their friends.</seg>
<seg id="66">Women have to be careful when going abroad, because they can be sold into slavery.</seg>
<seg id="67">"Latvian women are intelligent but much too trusting", Olga believes.</seg>
<seg id="68">There have been instances when couples have gone abroad, in order to get married a second time.</seg>
<seg id="69">That isn't lawful.</seg>
<seg id="70">Olga says that she was once with a man who looked like Jesus Christ.</seg>
<seg id="71">Tall, with long hair.</seg>
<seg id="72">When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.</seg>
<seg id="73">He had a severe head injury.</seg>
<seg id="74">He came back from the hospital as if he was a completely different person.</seg>
<seg id="75">"I had to leave him", Olga remembers.</seg>
<seg id="76">It was like being in hell, it was terrible.</seg>
<seg id="77">When asked what is the most unusual thing she has encountered, Olga says: "Every case is different, but the worst cases, are those where trust is abused."</seg>
<seg id="78">When a woman steals from her friend.</seg>
<seg id="79">Borrows money, and does not give it back.</seg>
<seg id="80">If you have a legal education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It's one thing to feel like a detective, but actually being one is a different experience", says Olga.</seg>
<seg id="82">Situations where distrust arises, can get out of hand, because women are often not ready for a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="83">They are not prepared to accept the result.</seg>
<seg id="84">They have not foreseen this situation, because they are not ready to lose their family.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not every woman is ready to accept reality.</seg>
<seg id="86">Often young girls, who have a taste for money, use rich married men.</seg>
<seg id="87">One man, who had his wife followed, said it could not be that she does not have another lover, as his previous wives had also cheated on him.</seg>
<seg id="88">"He had been married three times", recalls Olga.</seg>
<seg id="89">It must be the mans problem, if all his wives cheat on him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Olga tells the story, of a case when a woman left a man taking with her all the children, and she asked him if he had ever lifted up his hand against them.</seg>
<seg id="91">I usually hit them all the time, he replied.</seg>
<seg id="92">In such cases, I decline to take on the case.</seg>
<seg id="93">I find it interesting how cases are solved - are photos taken and shown to the spouse, if there is evidence of cheating?</seg>
<seg id="94">Could you please describe what usually takes place?</seg>
<seg id="95">"In parallel to detective work there is the matter of personal data protection", says Olga.</seg>
<seg id="96">That is a provocative matter.</seg>
<seg id="97">One law allows you to do anything, the other- nothing.</seg>
<seg id="98">For personal interests, we are allowed to take these kinds of photos and videos, but they are not allowed for public viewing.</seg>
<seg id="99">If the court receives such materials that do not comply with the law, then major problems may arise.</seg>
<seg id="100">To become a detective, education and experience is not enough, you must also be mentally healthy and meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="101">We do not take fingerprints, the police deal with that.</seg>
<seg id="102">I tell my clients - forget about TV serials, this is real life!</seg>
<seg id="103">In fact, when I worked with the police, I had to use dogs, and they really helped.</seg>
<seg id="104">"When it comes to drugs, we would not get anywhere without the dogs", Olga says.</seg>
<seg id="105">Some clients turn to me in regards to murder investigations, but I do not like to take on such cases.</seg>
<seg id="106">They are very serious cases.</seg>
<seg id="107">Now there are more and more male clients, because women tend to make fun of men.</seg>
<seg id="108">It used to be different.</seg>
<seg id="109">Now women go out and have fun, while the men sit at home with the kids.</seg>
<seg id="110">"Of course, respectable people suffer the most", according to Olga.</seg>
<seg id="111">I like Dale Carnegie.</seg>
<seg id="112">He tells us - stop worrying, and start living.</seg>
<seg id="113">We all know the saying, if somebody slaps you on one cheek, turn to give them the other, but this isn't what you should do!</seg>
<seg id="114">This has to be said, even though it's unpleasant to hear.</seg>
<seg id="115">You shouldn't be acting like this.</seg>
<seg id="116">You shouldn't fear to lose something, that's stopping you from living your life!</seg>
<seg id="117">You shouldn't become a masochist, and yet we do this to ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="118">Yes, my first case was directly linked to a cheating husband, when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that her husband was lying to her.</seg>
<seg id="119">She was constantly ringing and asking, what he was up to now.</seg>
<seg id="120">"I now ask all clients, if they are prepared to accept the situation where they find out that their husband really is cheating", Olga says.</seg>
<seg id="121">This isn't entertainment, it's life.</seg>
<seg id="122">If you come and hire a detective, you need to take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="123">It's not a play, or a TV show, it's real life.</seg>
<seg id="124">I am also a specialist in Reiki.</seg>
<seg id="125">It's a passion of mine and a part of Japanese medicine - using your hands to heal others.</seg>
<seg id="126">It's a very interesting field.</seg>
<seg id="127">Why did I choose to start practicing Reiki?</seg>
<seg id="128">It started with the large amount of adrenaline I had to deal with, I needed a way of calming myself down.</seg>
<seg id="129">Reiki not only soothes, but restores energy, lightens your spirits.</seg>
<seg id="130">"People leave my office positive and happy", says Olga.</seg>
<seg id="131">Her office wall is covered with Reiki symbols, and Olga says that they are not created with a brush, but with your fingers.</seg>
<seg id="132">I did not really start to study Reiki, until a book about it literally fell into my hands.</seg>
<seg id="133">I saw that as a sign.</seg>
<seg id="134">However, this is very personal.</seg>
<seg id="135">Find out more about Reiki here.</seg>
<seg id="136">Olga also sings.</seg>
<seg id="137">This is her hobby.</seg>
<seg id="138">We all want to be creative.</seg>
<seg id="139">I've played guitar since I was 11.</seg>
<seg id="140">I've recorded songs and clips.</seg>
<seg id="141">I am positive and smile, but it's necessary to rest, to recover.</seg>
<seg id="142">Others find refuge in alcohol, but it's Reiki that saves me.</seg>
<seg id="143">Alcohol helps you to lose yourself.</seg>
<seg id="144">The police use it a lot, because work is so stressful.</seg>
<seg id="145">"It can cause aggression, and unpredictable actions", she says.</seg>
<seg id="146">I'm interested in sports and Reiki.</seg>
<seg id="147">Aged 15, I used to play tennis.</seg>
<seg id="148">Then I loved riding horses.</seg>
<seg id="149">I disconnected in nature, wrote things, thought I'd like to write a book.</seg>
<seg id="150">In detective work there's a fine line between work and your life.</seg>
<seg id="151">"It's the kind of work, that you don't need to let into your life", she says.</seg>
<seg id="152">When asked how to reconcile work and private life, Olga says, "The person I love the most in the world lives in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="153">We have very strong feelings about each other.</seg>
<seg id="154">It's probably the realest love of my life.</seg>
<seg id="155">It's enough for me to think of him, and I already feel better.</seg>
<seg id="156">Detectives aren't usually trusting, but he has accepted my work.</seg>
<seg id="157">As it happens, I separate work from my private life.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, I don't feel trapped in this business.</seg>
<seg id="159">Reiki has given me direction in my life.</seg>
<seg id="160">When I was a child, I saw more than others did.</seg>
<seg id="161">Thanks to Reiki, I have opened up my intuition.</seg>
<seg id="162">There are many detectives, but few of them really make a living out of it.</seg>
<seg id="163">In any case it's a job where you work with your mind, and it can be hard to relax.</seg>
<seg id="164">You also need to be able to rest.</seg>
<seg id="165">"Otherwise you cannot renew yourself", Olga recognises.</seg>
<seg id="166">The worst case, which I ever took on, was the story of Constance.</seg>
<seg id="167">I worked a year on that case.</seg>
<seg id="168">The husband made a complete mockery of his wife.</seg>
<seg id="169">I made sure that the child and mother left for England - far away from danger.</seg>
<seg id="170">There was no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="171">We must not pity ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="172">We need to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="173">We shouldn't do that.</seg>
<seg id="174">We must be thankful for every day that we have.</seg>
<seg id="175">We must thank God.</seg>
<seg id="176">Every day we must say three good things to somebody else.</seg>
<seg id="177">We must do a good days work or devote the day to ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="178">We shouldn't baby our men.</seg>
<seg id="179">That's a big mistake.</seg>
<seg id="180">We need to understand that next to us is a man, not a child, and we need him to care for us.</seg>
<seg id="181">If it's not a good situation, you need to leave.</seg>
<seg id="182">You can go to church, that's something that has helped me a lot.</seg>
<seg id="183">There's no need to be fanatical, but do what you enjoy and what helps you.</seg>
<seg id="184">Nothing is going to change, if you don't change it yourself, you have to go away and change your own life.</seg>
<seg id="185">Under no circumstances should you put yourself and your children in danger.</seg>
<seg id="186">Don't sit and wait for something to happen.</seg>
<seg id="187">People were created to do good deeds, and help one other.</seg>
<seg id="188">If God created us, then we have a purpose and have not been born into this world for no reason.</seg>
<seg id="189">Don't sit around as if you have nothing to do!</seg>

<seg id="1">How best to prepare for a family photo session.</seg>
<seg id="2">Summer is still in full swing, yet creeping up on us is the new school year, which families tend to want to immortalise with photographs.</seg>
<seg id="3">So that everybody looks happy and beautiful in the pictures, it's worth thinking in advance about how to prepare for the photo session.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Ihappymama" tips are provided by large family mum Alexander Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.</seg>
<seg id="5">You must try taking pictures in nature, because it's so much more natural and harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's much more difficult to get children to relax and have fun in a photographers studio.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's a good idea for the whole family to choose a single style of clothing, preferably in the same range of colours.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, Aleksandra says that she chooses the outfits of all six members of the family so that the clothes have no more than three colours and have as little writing as possible on them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Don't forget about having a good time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Have fun, joke around, play together, but in no case should you shout or get angry at the children if they forget to follow instructions.</seg>
<seg id="11">The following advice comes to you straight from a professional photographer!</seg>
<seg id="12">You need to know exactly what you want to immortalise during the photo session, and be able to tell the photographer about it.</seg>
<seg id="13">For some, it will be beautiful, neat children and a perfect-looking family picture, for others - "life is the way it is", namely the desire for pictures to represent real, genuine emotions, or as the photographer describes it - "fleeing backs", " averted eyes", or a "snub nose".</seg>
<seg id="14">Of course, sometimes people want the "two in one", but that doesn't happen often.</seg>
<seg id="15">In any case, when attending a photo session, it must be understood that it's only a couple of hours of your life, and the less tension there is the better.</seg>
<seg id="16">Be yourself - not the strict mother who works, cooks, looks after children and so on, or the modern busy dad, who is constantly talking on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="17">And don't be hiding away in your shell.</seg>
<seg id="18">Be a family, remember how great is to hug each other, smile at each other and share a joke.</seg>
<seg id="19">And then the photographer's task will be to capture those moments of real emotion.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you have chosen a photographer, then trust him.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refrain from asking 250 times to see the picture, listen to her advice in regards to clothing, and where to take the best shots.</seg>
<seg id="22">Choose and iron all the clothes you need in advance of the photo session, so that you don't have to deal with that on the day.</seg>
<seg id="23">Plan your route and think about how much time you will need to get to the location of the photo session (especially if the session is going to take place in the studio, and time is limited).</seg>
<seg id="24">If you have small children, then choose an appropriate time of day for the photo session, so that you're not having pictures taken when the baby would usually be having a nap.</seg>
<seg id="25">And of course, do not forget to bring the kids food, biscuits, water and their favourite toys (only use toys and sweets in extreme situations).</seg>
<seg id="26">Let Dad know, if for example he might have to take off his socks, but advice articles don't usually write about these kind of things, and only photographers know where the real problems lie, says Marina.</seg>
<seg id="27">Don't drink a lot of water before the photo session, and try to sleep well the night before.</seg>
<seg id="28">And perhaps you could organise some kind of fun activity to do after the photo session.</seg>
<seg id="29">Go to an amusement park, eat some ice cream, have a go at roller-skating - do whatever your family enjoys the most.</seg>
<seg id="30">You'll have both great pictures and fond memories of the day you spent together.</seg>

<seg id="1">Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: raising the minimum wage - a wave of a magic wand or a brake to the economy?</seg>
<seg id="2">The issue of raising the minimum wage in public debates has an almost sacred cow status: either support the increase, or mention some unimpressive, general phrases.</seg>
<seg id="3">In view of the economic stagnation with a significant increase in risk (just barely avoiding a technical recession), we believe it is important to emphasise that raising the minimum wage would not be a magical wave of a wand to reduce income inequality, approaching the level of Western European wages and fulfilling the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the contrary - if the minimum wage raises too much, it causes more harm than good because its being raised reduces the competitiveness of enterprises and employment, particularly in sectors and regions with low income.</seg>
<seg id="5">At first glance, it appears that, despite the number of minimum wage increases in the post-crisis period, the Latvian minimum wage is not so high that raising of the usual few tens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses - it is only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries, the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, a different picture emerges if we compare the average salary in the country (%) - with the Latvian minimum wage (44%) which is higher than the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the number of Latvian minimum wage recipients is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6% [1]), by volume a similar minimum wage increase would affect more companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Latvian Bank's business survey, one in five Latvian companies said that the increase in the minimum wage in early 2014 was an important or very important factor in increasing the prices of products.</seg>
<seg id="9">This means that, firstly, the minimum wage increase was partly financed by consumers (that is, Latvian residents); secondly, the price rises to more than one company meant a loss of competitiveness both domestically and abroad (that was promoted by an increase in imports and limiting exports).</seg>
<seg id="10">Weaker competitiveness and declining production volumes for almost every fifteenth Latvian company was important in the laying off of employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, almost every eleventh company responded that raising the minimum wage was an important factor in them having to limit hiring new recruitment.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's worth remembering, that in 2011 -2013, the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, even if after the raise of the minimum wage in 2014, every fifth company noted a large improvement in productivity, it does not mean that a similar result could also be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase in a row could in fact deplete productivity options).</seg>
<seg id="14">Another important result is - the minimum wage rises due to a number of companies were also important in increasing compensation for employees who earn more than the minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, the minimum wage had a significant effect even in those companies where none of the employees received minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In recent years, the minimum wage increase in all three Baltic countries exceeded the nominal labour productivity (real productivity + inflation) growth.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henceforth, with labour productivity growth an unfounded minimum wage increase (even though it be at a low level in euro terms) will adversely affect the competitiveness of companies and employment.</seg>
<seg id="18">When assessing the merits of lifting the minimum wage, it is not sufficient to use solely an economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="19">It should also be considered, whether raising the minimum wage will be "tolerated" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is the most commonly used.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Latvian Bank survey shows that the highest concentration of employees earning minimum wage is in small enterprises (number of employees from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).</seg>
<seg id="21">At the end of 2013 the industrial and service sectors had more workers earning minimum wage (16% and 19%) than the sales (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).</seg>
<seg id="22">On the other hand, Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two-thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its future growth can be rather detrimental, reducing the demand for labour (ie, maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the shadow economy.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are signs that in 2014 - 2015 the sizeable increases implemented in the minimum wage (up by 27%) was a disincentive to growth in Latgale.</seg>
<seg id="24">For example, Latgale is the only Latvian region where the unemployment rate in 2015 was higher than in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="25">It should be noted that in Estonia and Lithuania, there is no region which has so significantly lagged behind the average wage when compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in all regions of Estonia the average salary in the country is at least twice the minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Taurage region, but even there the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average wage (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).</seg>
<seg id="28">Public discussions from time to time have called to lift the minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lack economic justifications, and it is not feasible in either the short or the long term.</seg>
<seg id="29">First, such a high percentage of the average wage, or even one so close to it, is not seen in any other EU country.</seg>
<seg id="30">Secondly, it would lift the minimum wage above the average wage in a number of sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcies and mass redundancies), in sectors such as clothing, leather goods production, fish processing, food services, as well as veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average salary in the private sector of Latgale.</seg>
<seg id="31">Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to 400-410 euros per month, as the Ministry of Welfare is currently offering, would make the Latvian minimum wage (by % of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="32">If the nominal productivity increases by 4%, while the minimum wage is at least twice the rate, it will clearly have a negative effect on the competitiveness of companies and employment.</seg>
<seg id="33">Such negative effects will be most prevalent in sectors and regions where the current minimum salary is often used, for example, in Latgale.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fact that a substantial increase in minimum wages cannot currently be afforded, means that other mechanisms are needed to support low-wage recipients.</seg>
<seg id="35">Immediate effect can be achieved by raising the personal income tax-free allowance (as much as the budget allows).</seg>
<seg id="36">Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality attainment of education, as well as poor health (which often occurs without going to the doctor for medical services in view of the high cost and a long waiting list) are the real causes of income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="37">The survey obtained responses from 521 Latvian companies in regards to the January 2014 minimum wage increases.</seg>
<seg id="38">The survey was issued by the European System of Central Banks Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.</seg>
<seg id="39">These figures represent companies with a workforce of no less than 10.</seg>
<seg id="40">This also explains the low proportion of workers with minimum wages in construction.</seg>

<seg id="2">Riga municipal police yesterday saved a baby from a hot car, while the child's parents threatened policemen with legal action for knocking out the car window, LETA was informed by Riga Municipal Police (RMP).</seg>
<seg id="3">Yesterday an agitated man ran towards the patrol, who reported that at the Spice shopping center parking lot he had noticed a car in which an infant had been inside for half an hour without any sign of the parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">Arriving at the scene, the eyewitness pointed out the car, which was parked in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the front passenger seat was a child seat, with the infant.</seg>
<seg id="6">The sun was shining directly onto the child.</seg>
<seg id="7">The baby was crying loudly and breathing intensely, their face was red and sweating.</seg>
<seg id="8">Considering that the owners of the vehicle were not there, it was immediately decided to knock out the cars rear glass, so as not to compromise the baby's health and life.</seg>
<seg id="9">The baby was removed in their seat from the hot vehicle, and doctors were summoned.</seg>
<seg id="10">The child's breathing was shallow, their skin was red and hot, so until the arrival of the medical team, the police put a cool compress on the baby's forehead.</seg>
<seg id="11">The medical team and the child's parents arrived at the scene almost simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="12">The infant's father, seeing his vehicle with a knocked out window, became aggressive and refused to let medics near the baby.</seg>
<seg id="13">Discussions were started with the parents, and it was explained to them that it is illegal to leave a child under the age of seven on their own.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the child was left in conditions hazardous to their health and life.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the interview the doctors examined the victim and found that hospitalisation was not required.</seg>

<seg id="1">LPF members may be required to suspend Pone.</seg>
<seg id="2">Members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) will in the near future be able to request the suspension of the current federation president Kaspars Pone, LETA learned from the Federation's former vice president Janis Dzenis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dzenis says that, taking into account recent days criticism of Pone and his activities in the federation, a number of LPF members have signed a letter asking to convene an LPF general meeting, which is the highest institution of the federation, having the power to decide on any issues raised by the LPF general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="4">Federation members are not satisfied with Pone's management style, while his presence at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, to which record-winning Latvian Olympic swimmer Alone Rybakov's coach Germanam Jakubovski was not allowed to go, is considered to be an unethical and unworthy presidential action.</seg>
<seg id="5">Woodpecker noted, that LPF members, as well as the Secretary-General of the federation, Aivars Platonov, have carried out great work in the development of the federation and sport, but Pone's contribution to the federation is not considered to be useful.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dzenis, who for a long time worked in the federation, explained that in the federation there had been a noticeable attempt to concentrate power in the hands of one person.</seg>
<seg id="7">Consequently, federation members may be required to amend the LPF regulatory statutes, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dzenis explained that there had long been dissatisfaction with Pone's work at the federation, but recent events had served as "the last straw" for federation members, resulting in them making the decision that action needed to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="9">The former vice president of the federation stated, that Pone's activity reduced the ability of coaches and the judges' council to carry out their work.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzenis explained that in order to ensure a faster decision-making process in the federation, the LPF members in a general meeting, made decisions on the amount of power that should be allowed to the management board, composed of Pone and two vice-presidents, in their leadership of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, as Dzenis acknowledged, Pone deceived the federation members.</seg>
<seg id="12">Federation members trusted Pone, believing that in this way the federation would be able to make decisions faster.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He betrayed the trust of the members, since practically speaking he took power into his own hands by taking an unethical step", stated Dzenis.</seg>
<seg id="14">"A person who should be acting as an example for other sports representatives, should not have such an attitude", stated Dzenis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dzenis believes that Pone tried to satisfy his own ambitions by being president, which is not an honourable attitude for the President of the LPF to have.</seg>
<seg id="16">Longtime LPF general secretary Vladimir Maslovskis told LETA that the federation's letter would be presented next week to the LPF general meeting will be held in a month's time.</seg>
<seg id="17">In his opinion, the general meeting must "discuss all the outstanding issues," and decide on further action.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Friday Pone had not yet been informed that members of the LPF were planning to convene a general meeting, which may decide on his dismissal from office.</seg>
<seg id="19">I know nothing about the organisation of this meeting, so I have no comment to make.</seg>
<seg id="20">With regard to the fact that members are not satisfied with my work, up to now only one example has been mentioned, in regards to the aforementioned coach Jakubovskis, who has expressed his dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="21">Before the London Olympics, when Ribakova had not yet approved participants, he approached the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) with a complaint, calling for Latvia not to send any athletes.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In this case Jakubovskis lost the role of team senior coach, because his actions did not correspond to the interests of the LPF", said Pone.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also stressed that so far he has not received any criticism from the LPF general meeting of members, who evaluate progress.</seg>
<seg id="24">"On the contrary, I have received news that the quality of work of the federation has improved", said the LPF president.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pone also explained that he has not gone to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics to have fun, but to work.</seg>
<seg id="26">Most Latvian people do not understand what being the President of the Federation entails, and what his duties are.</seg>
<seg id="27">People do not understand that we are in these positions voluntarily, and, for example, in contrast to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOC) leaders, we do not receive salaries.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the same time, we must ensure that sports federations have sufficient funding, since the LPF receives only 10% of the required amount from the government.</seg>
<seg id="29">During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with the International Federation and representatives of various international programs, including with international sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We have also entered into negotiations and are working on one of the stages of the 2018 World Cup taking place in Riga", said Pone.</seg>
<seg id="31">As shown by data from the portal "Firmas.lv", in 2015 LPF income totaled 249,444 euros, an increase of just under 36 000 euros more than in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="32">Approximately 40% of this amount last year went towards earmarked subsidies, the amount of which, compared to 2014, increased by around 10,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for members, joining and other annual fees to the LPF accounted for around 43% of revenue, or 109,442 euros.</seg>
<seg id="34">Donations and gifts to the federation last year accounted for a further 35,532 euros.</seg>
<seg id="35">Last year, the federation expenses compared to 2014 increased by around 70,000 euros, and in 2015 as a whole 263,876 euros were spent.</seg>
<seg id="36">The largest expenditure was not related to cash payments to persons or material costs, nor salaries - in the report, 215,733 euros is identified as "other expenses".</seg>
<seg id="37">20,549 euros is listed as cash payments to entities, while wages accounted for 14,684 euros.</seg>
<seg id="38">If the federation concluded 2014 with a positive balance, then the LPF ended 2015 with a negative balance.</seg>
<seg id="39">As reported, the Ministry of Education (IZM) requested clarification of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for the LPF President Pone's participation in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, to which Latvian swimmer Rybakov's coach, Jakubovskis, had not gone.</seg>

<seg id="1">65% of Venezuelans want to oust Maduro, the question is if they are willing to fight for it</seg>
<seg id="2">Two out of three Venezuelans want to revoke President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seems to be whether or not they are willing to fight for it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there is "no time" for the recall vote to take place this year - securing Chavismo's grip of power until 2019 - people in Caracas went about their day as if nothing had happened.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals," said Rafael Deyan, a 36-year-old office clerk taking a break in Altamira Square on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against Maduro's regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet now, when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energy.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons," said Deyan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, more informed, are willing to mobilize in the future but admit Venezuelans are less motivated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Electoral board president Tibisay Lucena's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process.</seg>
<seg id="10">I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reyes, 60, told Fox News Latino.</seg>
<seg id="11">So on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: motivating people to go out to the streets and protest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when it comes to protesting against the government's maneuvers to block the effort, turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people are focused in making food lines, while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014," said Cipriano Heredia, a lawmaker for the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="15">After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government claim President Maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage Venezuelans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor.</seg>
<seg id="17">If he were ousted this year, however, he is mandated to call for a general election.</seg>
<seg id="18">The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a statement Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The remaining steps for the realization of the Presidential Recall Referendum need to be pursued clearly, concretely and without delay, and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country," it read.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, said change is not likely anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I think that there will not be a referendum this year, unless the social unrest and protests grow much more," he told FNL.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that in his view Lucena and the government are breaking the law, but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people don't protest loud enough.</seg>
<seg id="23">The opposition has called for a big rally on Sept. 1st in Caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year.</seg>
<seg id="24">We want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day.</seg>
<seg id="25">The government will feel the pressure," Heredia said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Salamanca thinks that the situation can't wait that long.</seg>
<seg id="27">"They should have a quicker and stronger response to Lucena's announcement because it practically kills the referendum," the expert told FNL.</seg>
<seg id="28">Congressman Heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner, but other groups prefer to have more time to organize.</seg>
<seg id="29">The opposition has to be careful now.</seg>
<seg id="30">If people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition," said Salamanca.</seg>
<seg id="31">The referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country's electorate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="32">Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017, Chavismo will be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="33">But some are not that optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Our party wants political change this year.</seg>
<seg id="35">"If the government closes down the electoral path, we will have to explore other legal options," Heredia told FNL.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ogre is celebrating sports for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Today Ogre Sports Centre Stadium held a Sports Festival organised by Ogre pensioner society.</seg>
<seg id="3">Seniors met up at Ogre Sports Centre Stadium for Development of Sport Work organiser Sanita Taurina, who had prepared a special programme for the sports festival participants.</seg>
<seg id="4">This time individual results will not be evaluated, but the sports festival participants will be divided into four teams.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Each participant will add their effort to their team and see the result", explains S.Tauriņa.</seg>
<seg id="6">Participants will undergo four tasks - basketball quick shots, Eiffel Tower construction together with a memory game, floorball agility skills, and summer skiing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to be successful in all four festival programme activities, participants had to carry out warm-up tasks - "Unity circle", "The purse Dance", "Parachute", as well as three relays - Riding a horse, catching a frisbee and badminton.</seg>
<seg id="8">All tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and Sports Festival participants carried them out with joy, smiles and funny comments in support of one another.</seg>
<seg id="9">Special excitement was caused by the summer skiing, which was held by organisers wearing costumes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Races were closely followed by Ogre Sports Centre volunteers, who led the tasks, recorded the results and did not ban the giving of helpful advice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ogres pinecone symbol was present throughout the event, which helped to inspire Sports Festival participants.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ogre seniors showed that they were quite athletic, attractive and in good shape.</seg>
<seg id="13">Green team member Peter Zeps took one minute exactly to throw a ball into the basketball ring eight times, only one effective shot behind his team-mate John Staudzs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ogre pensioners are active.</seg>
<seg id="15">Organised bus tours are always full, dances are attended by about 300 people.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Twice a week we meet at the Family Support Centre in rooms where we can play novuss, table tennis, and use the training machines," says Ogre Pensioners' Association chairman John Staudzs.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the end of the Sports festival all participants received Ogre Sports Centre's thanks for their participation, but the greatest benefit they gained was exercise in the fresh air, a good mood and spent time together.</seg>

<seg id="1">Premier League 2016-17 previews No19 West Bromwich Albion</seg>
<seg id="2">Guardian writers" predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction but the average of our writers" tips)</seg>
<seg id="3">Last season's position 14th</seg>
<seg id="4">Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 1,000-1</seg>
<seg id="5">Until last week it looked like a case of new season, same old West Bromwich Albion: 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic Tony Pulis.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then Jeremy Peace sold his 88% stake in the club to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, the archetypal safe pair of hands, was immediately made the bookmakers" favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired.</seg>
<seg id="7">The landscape has undeniably altered in the Black Country - and not just at The Hawthorns, but a few miles north-west in Wolverhampton, too, where new Chinese owners wasted no time in relieving Kenny Jackett of his services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pulis, however, has been given reassurances by Lai that his job is not in immediate threat, and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have no wish to change the club's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree," he said upon taking over.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term.</seg>
<seg id="11">First and foremost, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier League and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division.</seg>
<seg id="12">I believe it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such is Pulis's record, the first aspect should not be too problematic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides.</seg>
<seg id="15">To progress from last season's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front.</seg>
<seg id="16">Only Aston Villa, tailed off at the bottom, scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes, by some stretch the division's worst.</seg>
<seg id="17">They failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of their 10 victories, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0.</seg>
<seg id="19">Predictably, a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces.</seg>
<seg id="20">Little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at The Hawthorns, perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with Villa in late January, when the visitors looked the more likely.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the flip side, only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Those defenders are often underappreciated, not least Jonny Evans, who is said to have Arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Championship and it would take a hefty fee for Albion to sell.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ben Foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield.</seg>
<seg id="25">Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32, and Claudio Yacob is underrated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of Saido Berahino's future remains unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bids from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected under Peace's ownership but the former remain keen and Mark Hughes is happy to be patient.</seg>
<seg id="28">After last season was close to a write-off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through.</seg>
<seg id="29">The striker is undoubtedly talented but with, as Pulis mentioned more than once, people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable.</seg>
<seg id="30">Albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former England Under-21 international go but their £15m move for Diafra Sakho broke down days before the takeover, with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="31">It places a lot of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomón Rondón, who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals, especially if Rickie Lambert continues to be as ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="32">The decision to release Victor Anichebe and Stéphane Sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="33">Pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts - in the final game of last season, a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, is unlikely to become the norm.</seg>
<seg id="34">He will return to the tried and tested but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season, becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the Premier League, and is also highly rated in the England underage system.</seg>
<seg id="36">Matt Phillips, a £5.5m signing from Queens Park Rangers, will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one.</seg>
<seg id="38">"All over," Pulis told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="39">Every position that you look at.</seg>
<seg id="40">The back players, midfield players and front players, we have to strengthen.</seg>
<seg id="41">The targets have been there, we know what we want.</seg>
<seg id="42">Getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged, mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process.</seg>
<seg id="43">The season could be defined by how they start, with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="44">By that point the pressure on Pulis will have eased or become insurmountable.</seg>
<seg id="45">And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.</seg>

<seg id="2">The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company.</seg>
<seg id="3">The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of £15bn and a deficit of as much as £700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.</seg>
<seg id="7">Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to £300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control.</seg>
<seg id="9">Johnston said the trustees accepted it "would not be realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government.</seg>
<seg id="13">Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable."</seg>
<seg id="14">Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on," Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.</seg>
<seg id="17">The pension trustees" willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel.</seg>
<seg id="18">The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.</seg>
<seg id="19">Johnston added: "The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund.</seg>
<seg id="20">Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.</seg>

<seg id="2">An Olympics commentator working for Canadian broadcaster CBC suffered embarrassment on Thursday night when he confused Michael Phelps for rival Ryan Lochte.</seg>
<seg id="3">Elliotte Friedman mixed the pair up for the duration of the 200m individual medley final, which Phelps won to claim his 22nd Olympic gold medal.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Phelps streaked home for the win, Friedman believed him to be Lochte, Phelps' compatriot and long-term rival at the top of world swimming.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friedman shouted: "Finally, he's going to do it!"</seg>
<seg id="6">Ryan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps in this event!</seg>
<seg id="7">Phelps might not even make the podium.</seg>
<seg id="8">Phelps, however, won while Lochte trailed in fourth.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the immediate moments after Phelps touched for gold, CBC's broadcast fell silent.</seg>
<seg id="10">Friedman, admirably, admitted to his error immediately.</seg>
<seg id="11">I apologise, I got my lanes mixed up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Phelps with the gold," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism has been widely praised after the mistake, owned up to his error once again in the hours after the event and apologised to viewers on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm sorry everyone.</seg>
<seg id="15">I blew it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"No excuses," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Phelps, meanwhile, broke a 2,168-year-old record for the most all-time individual Olympic titles with the victory.</seg>
<seg id="18">The previous record was held by Leonidas of Rhoses, who is believed to have won more Olympic titles at the ancient games than anyone else.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to the acquired information, these cyber attackers hacked the former European NATO Force Commander General Philip Breedlove's correspondence and the "Open Society" Institute of workshops that are part of the projects supported by millionaire George Soros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The attackers posted the information they obtained on the website DCLeaks.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">There they posted correspondence and data on the "Open Society" Institute's activities.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is reported that hackers had access to the fund's computers for about a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The news agency claims that they are the same hackers who carried out the attack on the US Democratic Party's computers and who are run by Russian special services.</seg>
<seg id="9">US intelligence already warned Congress top officials about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news agency "Reuters" reports that they have information that at that time a number of politicians told special services - cyber attacks coordinated by two Russian intelligence or controlled organisations controlled by them.</seg>
<seg id="11">But congressmen have not been able to pass on this information to victims of cyber attacks, because it was classed as secret.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scandal of the attacks on the Democratic Party's computers began after around 20 thousand e-mails were published on the internet, written by representatives of the party in the US presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="13">Party candidate Hillary Clinton said that the leaking of those letters was organised by the Russian special services.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="1">Liepaja home insulation requires consent by two-thirds of inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="2">If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and specifically talk about the technical condition of the building, and such an opportunity exists to receive support and rearrange the buildings, it is quite silly not to use it.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the most significant changes is that EU co-financing can be obtained this year by any apartment building, the only condition is that it has to have an insulated façade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously, funding could only be used on a terraced apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="5">The biggest worry for house managers can arise at the organisation of the apartment owners meeting.</seg>
<seg id="6">A major problem that is currently delaying the process is that it requires 67% of apartment owners consent.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The previous programme only needed 51%," says SIA "Liepajas house keeper" (LNA) Project manager Tom Cirulis.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure that number, because such a large amount of apartment owners do not come to the general meetings," says the "APSE House Service" company's Project manager Gints Locmelis.</seg>
<seg id="9">The largest house maintenance service in Liepaja - "APSE House Service" and the LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plans by the new programming period in 2020 to have renovated at least 50 multi-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They do not exclude the possibility that at the beginning of the work it will be hard to convince people to vote for the renovation, but with each new project implemented, public attitudes should improve.</seg>
<seg id="11">I also had to get a bank loan, I needed 76% of the domestic population.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I had to talk, explain, what will happen - but I managed to get those signatures," says an elderly inhabitant of the most energy-efficient building in Latvia, Vita Iesalniece.</seg>
<seg id="13">She agrees with Janis, who also lives in a heated building.</seg>
<seg id="14">Well, it's not what half of them think, and the other half can't agree with them.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No, of course it is important that everyone agrees with the whole event," says Janis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Such regulatory changes were proposed by representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.</seg>
<seg id="17">They explain that, with 51% of votes, the banks are not able to raise the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the last programming period.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most commercial banks require two-thirds of apartment owners signatures.</seg>
<seg id="19">As one of the recommendations of the house managers the Ministry of Economics of the European Union Fund Head Anda Lagzdiņa mentions, there is the possibility of introducing the people with existing examples and the various benefits that would result from renovating buildings, such as energy saving.</seg>

<seg id="1">In his youth, Aaron had been very angry with the world for his mother's death.</seg>
<seg id="2">The capture of the potential suicide bomber in Canada was worthy of a thriller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everything began when Canadian police received an intercepted video recording from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Very early in the morning, the Royal Canadian police received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among other things, it contained a so-called "martyrdom" video recording, which is a recording of a nameless man who is clearly in the last stages of preparation for an attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">"And he is preparing by creating home-made explosive devices," said Canadian Police Deputy Chief, Mike Kabana.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the video recording, a man wearing a black mask speaking in English and Arabic threatens Canadians and promises to take revenge for everything they have done to Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="8">After about three hours of using facial and voice recognition software, Canadian police were able to identify this man.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was 24 year old Aaron Driver.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was already on probation under supervision for glorification of terrorism and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the court's decision he was forbidden from continuing to do so and also from engaging with any radical organisations.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, authorities did not until then believe that Driver would present any physical danger to others.</seg>
<seg id="13">When police arrived at his home in the town of Strathroy in Ontario, the young man had come out and entered a taxi.</seg>
<seg id="14">At that point, police attempted to arrest him, but Driver, sitting on the rear seat, had already triggered the bomb.</seg>
<seg id="15">So as not to let him detonate the other bomb, the police started shooting at the young man.</seg>
<seg id="16">He died from the resulting injuries.</seg>
<seg id="17">The taxi driver was not harmed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Wayne Driver, the father of the neutralised terrorist, said in an interview for Canadian television that his son had embraced Islam during adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="19">It had originally helped him with giving up drugs and alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="20">However Aaron was a problem teen, who for a long time had been very angry with the world for his mother's death, added his father.</seg>
<seg id="21">Only today, when I saw the video on the news, did I realise how far he took it.</seg>
<seg id="22">I had no idea that he was so completely radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And I also was not aware that he knew how to speak Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.</seg>
<seg id="24">Canadian police recognised - if they had arrived a few hours later, the story could have been a very different one.</seg>

<seg id="1">Radevica will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian athletes</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Olympian and athlete Ineta Radevica tells LTV from the Olympic studio that Heptathlon athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidina's Friday's performance in the first two disciplines were not bad, considering that the athlete had previously experienced an injury.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also, during the high jump Laura started with her right foot and not with the left like usual.</seg>
<seg id="4">Radevica pointed out that it's comparable to someone used to writing with their right hand, suddenly being forced to write with their left.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore Ikauniece-Admidinas result, taking into account her injuries, is not at all bad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Radevic revealed that though she's not yet had a chance to meet with Ikauniece-Admidina, she has been avidly following her athletic attempts and sympathising with her.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ineta learned about Laura's injuries recently and expressed support for the sportswoman, saying that athletes should not wrap themselves up in cotton wool, but should prove their character and fighting spirit.</seg>
<seg id="8">In terms of other sports Radevica believes that Olympic standards are very high, so for a Latvian athlete to be criticised for going to Rio only as a tourist, is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="9">She remembered that when she went to her first Olympics and gained 13th place, she was called a tourist, and that made her experience negative emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ineta will sometimes recall her starting matches, not only her Olympic attempts.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I prefer to remember my emotions, rather than the results," recalling her sports experiences, revealed Radevica.</seg>
<seg id="12">She says, that it has always been important for there to be people in the stands emphasising with her, sending her support.</seg>
<seg id="13">This year however Radevica will go to Rio as a tourist, so that with her presence she can support other Latvian athletes.</seg>
<seg id="14">She says that she will definitely visit the track and field competitions.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2010 Ineta Radevica won the European championships.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens she took 13th place in the long jump and 20th place in the triple jump, but the athlete did not compete in the 2008 Olympics due to being pregnant with her son.</seg>
<seg id="17">In London, as already mentioned, Radevica came 4th place in the long jump.</seg>

<seg id="2">A series of bomb blasts across five of Thailand's southern provinces targeted popular tourist destinations on Thursday and Friday, leaving four people dead and many more injured, after the country voted to approve a military-backed constitution.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two explosions first hit the seaside resort of Hua Hin on Thursday night, before another blast struck on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The town is located some 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first blast killed one Thai woman and injured 20 people, 10 of them foreigners, police said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Authorities confirmed that other blasts had targeted the southern cities of Phuket, Trang and Surat Thani.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two bombs exploded in the town of Patong in Phuket and two more in Phang Nga, another tourist region just north of Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="8">A total of 11 bomb blasts struck the country over the last 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="9">The blasts were not linked to Islamic extremism but acts of local sabotage, Royal Thai Police official Col. Krisana Patanacharoen said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's too soon to jump to any conclusion," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what we know for sure is that the incidents are not linked directly to any kinds of terrorism, in fact it's local sabotage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Investigation officials collect evidence from the crime scene after a small bomb exploded in Hua Hin on August 12, 2016.</seg>
<seg id="13">A string of bomb attacks targeting Thailand's crucial tourism industry have killed four people, officials said on August 12, sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are no conflicts in the country that may lead to terrorists being in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="16">No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not accused any particular group, but the explosions occurred in the same week that Thai voters approved a new constitution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The three southern provinces of Hua Hin, Phuket and Phang Nga all rejected the military-backed referendum, and the Muslim-majority southeastern provinces of Thailand have faced an insurgency that has left more than 6,500 people dead since 2004.</seg>
<seg id="18">The blasts came on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit, a public holiday in the country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Porgy and Bess - something we've been waiting for, for a long time!</seg>
<seg id="2">There are an endless amount of operas that have never been heard in Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are also those that are heard only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it seems strange, that since the late seventies George Gershwin's opus Porgy and Bess has never been staged, apart from the solo number Summertime having its periodic appearance on stages (including the summer festival of the same name organised by Inese Galante), and at individual student projects, guest performances and the like.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are reasons for this - since Latvia is a civilized Western country, it is bound to Gershwin's family heirs ruling and copyright licencing in regards to Porgy and Bess is valid until 2030.</seg>
<seg id="6">The consent procedure is not simple.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, in creating a full staging, the author stated that all fourteen soloists must be black.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Latvia, of course, not much is known about the discussions and context of race in America, and it would be hard to respect the composer's request.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a compromise, four artistic black American singers and their Latvian colleagues helped to brightly voice the Cesis Art Festival's 10th anniversary on August 6th, recreating Gershwin's magical sounds, which intertwine the European classical music tradition with American jazz rhythms, gospel, 20th century style dances and memorable hits, including the poignant Catfish Row with Porgy as a completely gnarled beggar, and Bess's pretty butterfly love story, with a musical quality that deserves documenting in musical history.</seg>
<seg id="10">Firstly, it's due to the National Symphony Orchestra and conductor Andris Poga.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the complex spatial layout of the outdoor areas for concert performances in Cesis Castle Park, with the orchestra in the side stage next to the stage, where there were soloists and singing (and amazing dancing!) in the chorus. The overall sound was stylistically nuanced, rich in contrast and accurate for the strings, brass, and wind instruments, as well as the piano (played by Martins Zilberts).</seg>
<seg id="12">Second, the great soloists of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">The charismatic dramatic baritone Lester Lynch (Porgy) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire includes both baritone and bass-baritone parts, especially Verdi's operas.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has sung the role of Porgy countless times, on several occasions playing Crown - in this opera he was like a fish in water, and even inspired his colleagues by conjuring up a fishing village full of poor people with an emotional atmosphere of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Latonia Moore in her second Porgy and Bess concert (the first was held in 2012, with no less than with the Berlin Philharmonic and Sir Simon Rattle) revealed herself to have a range of flexible and vital vocal styles, able to combine dramatically toned timbre and fantastic piano in the upper register.</seg>
<seg id="16">She's not one of today's brightest stars without a reason.</seg>
<seg id="17">The attractive tenor of Jamaican origin Jermaine Smith, who Andris Poga once saw on the Boston stage, has played the role of drug dealer Sportin'life on four continents.</seg>
<seg id="18">In it he demonstrates his simultaneous dancing and singing skills as well as his training as a musical actor.</seg>
<seg id="19">Smith is one of those rare gems, whose voice still seems to be hiding yet undiscovered vocal features as it did 15 years ago, when he accidentally found his opera voice, when he was trying to make his friends laugh.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's incredible, that even from 24 rows away and in relative darkness, Jermaine Smith's expressive gestures let you see in his hands a bag of "magic dust", even when there is nothing there.</seg>
<seg id="21">How could the poverty-stricken Bess not follow such a Mephistophelian tempter, who can turn empty space into the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?</seg>
<seg id="22">The role of Crown is played by the timbrally generously endowed Rodney Clark.</seg>
<seg id="23">The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloists team Cesis staging was Sonoras Vaices version of Siren - a luxurious upper register, skillful balancing between speaking and singing of the text, according to the changing voice line, vocal acrobatics and drama filled performance both Siren's lament My Man is Gone Now and the stylish leadsinger's prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="24">Margarita Wilson's voice fit the role of Clara well, but she voiced the iconic Summertime lullaby at the outset a little too loudly and nervously, not expressing its true character.</seg>
<seg id="25">Colourful and glamorous voices were provided by Mikhail Culpajevam, Richard Macanovskis, and Andris Lapins (especially with the castle-ruin walls scene, with the crab-seller and the strawberry woman Irma Pavera's soprano tessitura).</seg>
<seg id="26">Bright characters were played by Ilona Bagel, Richard Miller, Emila Kivlenieks, as well as the speaking roles, which Ivo Martinsons standing out in the character of the investigator, with the white lawyer Archdale unexpectedly played by Cesis festival director and actor Juris Zagars.</seg>
<seg id="27">A historical Kairisa concert performance space was created by the three-dimensional concept of the choir soloists working on steps - mainly on the proscenium, coming and going on the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was a dynamic and a rather comical situation, as the Latvian musicians held folders of musical notations in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although their presence has quite a prosaic explanation.</seg>
<seg id="30">First, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes made it difficult to keep up with which role they were playing).</seg>
<seg id="31">Second, Porgy and Bess has a lot of dialogue, phrases inserted into conversation, rejoinders, which are easier to keep track of if you have the notes in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sub-titling machine at Cesis really helped listeners to follow along.</seg>
<seg id="33">The weather wasn't as good as it could have been, and it rained through quite a bit of the first half of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this did not prevent the majority of listeners from staying until the end, to cheer for the artists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Nine in the evening is a pretty late start time for a full-length opera, especially if you have a long journey home from Cesis, however, we're lucky to have the opera Porgy and Bess back on the Latvian music scene and, most likely, it will be one of this summer's most prominent musical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="36">The opera has also visited Liepaja, where it played yesterday evening, though in quite different acoustic conditions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday, on August 11th, at around eight o'clock in the evening, the police received a call from the grandmother of one of the terrorised children, who was alarmed at the fact that in Lomonosov Street, in the children's playground, a man was threatening children with an axe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Law enforcers immediately reacted to the call and arrived at the scene, where they found this man with an axe, who at the time of the event was very much under the influence of alcohol - 3.07 per mille.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was found that the man, born in 1962, had already threatened children, to try to stop them from crying.</seg>
<seg id="5">But this time, frightening the children, the aggressive man used an axe which he used to attack children's playground equipment.</seg>
<seg id="6">The man was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is now undergoing criminal proceedings, charged with serious public disorder in the form of apparent lack of respect for society or impudence, ignoring generally accepted rules of conduct and disturbing people's peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="8">Such a crime is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or a short-term imprisonment or community service, or a fine and probation supervision for up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Federation presidents of the Olympic Games usually use guest accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Sports federation presidents usually visit the Olympics venue for a few days and use guest credentials, which can change names, so that during the competition they will have several owners, LETA learned from the Latvian Olympic Team (LOV) spokeswoman Marita Vilcina.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday an uproar resulted after the statements of Germana Jakubovska, the coach of the Olympic swimmer Alone Rybakov, which revealed that at the last minute, the Latvian Federation (LPF) head Kaspars Pone decided to go to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, while the coach had to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="4">Later it became known, that Pone arrived in Brazil with coach accreditation, which the president himself expressed surprise at, because "now I'm not allowed access to anywhere".</seg>
<seg id="5">As Vilcina reported, only two federation presidents lived in the London Olympics athletes village - Pone, as well as the head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS) Guntis Zalitis.</seg>
<seg id="6">Olympic athletes live in the village, as well as officials, including, for example, coaches, doctors, and an administration delegation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, it's likely that Pone had had coach accreditation in London, as well..</seg>
<seg id="8">"The other federation presidents arrive as guests, and they have interchangeable accreditation - they're here a couple of days and then it's used by someone else," said Vilcina, explaining why the federation presidents don't usually live in the Olympic village.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pone arrived in Rio de Janeiro in late July and will leave Brazil on August 13th, so most likely he will be there for longer than all the other national federation presidents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Significantly, the Latvian athletes swimming competitions last for one day only - August 10th.</seg>
<seg id="11">Latvia will be represented in 11 sports in the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, and LETA's calculations show that six or seven federation presidents will go to these most important competitions, which are held every four years.</seg>
<seg id="12">Zalitis will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) president Hugo Japins will be at next week's BMX competition, the Latvian Windsurfing Federation president Ansis Dale plans to fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16th, when Katie Birzule's competitions will have come to an end, and the Latvian Fighting federation president Dzintars Urbanciks - a day earlier.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, the president of the Shooting Federation of Latvia Karlis Kreslins is planning to attend next week, when the shooter Dainis Upelnieks competitions will already be over.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Latvian Judo Federation president Raymond Rublovskis did not arrive at Rio de Janeiro, at least during the Latvian athletes competitions, though it was planned; the Latvian Canoe Federation currently has no president; the weightlifting Latvian society is still experiencing conflicts and its athletic international competitions apply to the Latvian Olympic Committee.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, Latvian Volleyball Federation president Atis Sausnitis and Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to travel to Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasilyev has been visiting Latvia frequently in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most recently, he judged the "Miss and Mister Latvia 2016" finals contestants and found that the Latvian beauties, in contrast to the Russian representatives of the fair sex, could boast more natural breasts and lips that are not improved with silicone and botulinum injections.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a conversation with the "Evening News" Alexander Vasilyev talked about being for many years the jury president of the popular "Miss Russia" beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why he eagerly engaged in the judging of the "Miss and Mister Latvia 2016" participants.</seg>
<seg id="6">Asked the difference between Latvian beauty pageant standards and similar competitions in Russia, Vasilyev stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: "the Russian beauties have a fuller bust, unlike the Latvians."</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the Latvian girls are beautifully dressed and coiffured, and boast a natural beauty rather than plastic surgery accomplished miracles.</seg>
<seg id="8">We therefore particularly welcome the Latvian beauty pageant participants with their natural beauty.</seg>
<seg id="9">In connection with his professional activities in Latvia, Vasilyev has big plans.</seg>
<seg id="10">Currently, the fashion historian has a collection exhibition "Domesticated nature" on show in the Decorative Arts and Design Museum.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also, in Ventspils Livonian Order Castle, can be seen the Vasilyev exhibition "Wedding gowns 1860-2010".</seg>
<seg id="12">Vasilyev loves Ventspils so much, that he spent a couple of days enjoying the hospitality of the city and going for walks along the sea.</seg>
<seg id="13">I really like Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially now that across Europe there is the threat of terrorism, this is a real corner of paradise.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Spending time and relaxing in Latvia is a pleasure", says the fashion guru.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, on 23 November, Alexander Vasilyev will reveal a private fashion museum in the Old Town.</seg>

<seg id="1">Please help!</seg>
<seg id="2">Please donate towards the treatment of our son, brother, and grandson.</seg>
<seg id="3">As Rinalds' family, we are grateful for the amazing people who surround us and God, that we have the chance to save Rinalds, but, unfortunately, there is currently no opportunity to fully cover the medical costs by our own means.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rinalds Grinbergs is an 11 year old boy from Tukums, who in late July was diagnosed with brain tumours.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year he graduated from the fourth class in Milzkalnes primary school with a note of excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.</seg>
<seg id="6">It seemed that everything he tried at, he succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="7">A healthy, lively, tenacious, diligent and active boy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Always smiling and happy.</seg>
<seg id="9">July 26th will stay in our family's memory for the rest of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last couple of weeks he struggled with nausea, headaches, but doctors blamed it on a stomach virus.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning, it seemed that must be the case.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because who would have thought that such "innocent" symptoms were really a warning of the unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="13">On July 26th we received the diagnosis - Rinalds had a growth on his brain.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fluid was rapidly accumulating in his brain, but all Latvian doctors would be able to do to help would be to make a bypass operation to divert excess fluid, since a direct surgical operation on the tumour was practically unavailable.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were also unable to determine whether the tumour was benign or malignant.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only treatment that the state would pay for: start a course of radiation, and see what happens.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was like being in a nightmare - they wanted to experiment, and see what the result would be.</seg>
<seg id="18">Luckily we got a chance to show Rinalds test results to a doctor in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="19">He is vice president of the World Association of Neurosurgery, and one of the world's leading neurosurgeons.</seg>
<seg id="20">He offered to carry out the operation, since as it turned out, he needed to be operated on immediately.</seg>
<seg id="21">The tumour was putting tremendous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications was too large.</seg>
<seg id="22">They also needed to quickly determine whether the tumour was benign or malignant, in order to plan further treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">They didn't need to think about it for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to rescue their son.</seg>
<seg id="24">And with fantastic speed, on August 8th Rinalds together with his mum Evija arrived in Spain and was operated on August 9th.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a very difficult surgery, that lasted for more than 6 hours.</seg>
<seg id="26">The operation took place at the "Santa Elena" clinic.</seg>
<seg id="27">They succeeded in removing most of the tumour, relieving pressure on the brain, and obtaining samples for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="28">Rinalds was soon up from bed and like a typical teenager, asked for fries for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now he is just waiting for the results from the oncology analyses.</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to Dr. Araezam and the people in charge of the clinic, who understood the situation and the need for an urgent operation, without full payment for treatment prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="31">They trusted that the remaining amount will be paid, and only requested the first 10,000 euros as a deposit, before going through with the operation and saving Rinald's life.</seg>
<seg id="32">The parents managed to raise 6,000 euros by selling equipment, and they were able to borrow from relatives and friends the rest of the required amount for travel expenses, accommodation, and the hospitals first installment.</seg>
<seg id="33">But we still need at least 24,000 euros to pay for the first phase of treatment in Spain and return the money that we have borrowed for the first payment.</seg>
<seg id="34">Please help us to pay for this operation, that was so important for Rinalds health.</seg>
<seg id="35">Each euro will help towards covering the cost of the already carried out operation, and to be able to successfully continue Rinald's treatment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What's Vladimir Putin Up To?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's difficult to judge the truth of these claims.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ukraine denies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">An open-source analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, found some indications of a firefight on Saturday, but little to back up Moscow's grander claims.</seg>
<seg id="5">Russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends, particularly within the fog of Ukraine's still-ongoing conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all false.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power Crimea, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="8">An attempted attack in Crimea is not out of the question, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday - before the supposed attack occurred.</seg>
<seg id="10">These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense.</seg>
<seg id="11">A disturbingly familiar Russian escalation</seg>
<seg id="12">Some reports indicate that Russia's troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim.</seg>
<seg id="14">Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation.</seg>
<seg id="16">That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to "protect" ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force.</seg>
<seg id="18">What is Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?</seg>
<seg id="19">Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive," Mr. Galeotti said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rather, "We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension."</seg>
<seg id="25">International peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="26">By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength," Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And the only real strength is to say, "I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to." "</seg>
<seg id="29">Positioning for a bargain with the West</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process.</seg>
<seg id="31">What does this actually get him?</seg>
<seg id="32">For one, it allows Russia to continue asserting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australia's.</seg>
<seg id="33">For another, it positions Moscow as having a veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control.</seg>
<seg id="34">It may also serve Mr. Putin's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria - on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally - as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation's economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists.</seg>
<seg id="37">But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office.</seg>
<seg id="38">Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="40">But Mr. Obama is seen as "looking for resolutions, not conflicts," Mr. Galeotti said.</seg>
<seg id="41">So there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia's weaker neighbor guessing about what's coming next.</seg>
<seg id="43">An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was 2014, not 2013.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds to Fight Zika</seg>
<seg id="2">The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month.</seg>
<seg id="4">That would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time, as locally acquired cases of Zika infection increase in Miami.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of last week, 7,350 cases of Zika had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ms. Burwell said that 15 infants had been born with Zika-related birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The local spread of the illness in the continental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government's response.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made a campaign stop in Wynwood, the Miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted Zika cases, and pressed Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Obama and congressional Republicans have been at odds for most of the year over Zika.</seg>
<seg id="11">In February, Mr. Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Republicans balked, demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of a Republican measure that would have allocated $1.1 billion to fight Zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for Planned Parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus, which can be sexually transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deadlock prompted the White House in April to shift $589 million in Ebola funding to the Zika effort, about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Thursday, Ms. Burwell said that her department had used most of that money, and that it would be gone by the end of August.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays," Ms. Burwell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democrats seized on the announcement to berate Republicans for failing to provide additional money for Zika.</seg>
<seg id="19">At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, to bring Congress back to advance such a measure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Every possible option is being exhausted, and now we're going into the National Institutes of Health, which is supposed to be a priority," Ms. Pelosi said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aides to Mr. Ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the Obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the Zika issue.</seg>
<seg id="22">The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a Zika vaccine on 80 human subjects, and hoped to begin a second phase in "Zika-endemic countries" in early 2017.</seg>
<seg id="23">But without more funding now, officials said Thursday, the research would halt in its tracks.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ms. Burwell said she would transfer to the Zika efforts $34 million in N.I.H. funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="25">Another $47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="26">That money will come out of a variety of accounts, including $19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to "severely curtail many of their critical efforts" against Zika without action from Congress.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the last four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related syndromes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thai Leader Links Attacks on Tourist Sites to Constitution Change</seg>
<seg id="2">The head of the Thai junta urged his countrymen on Friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were "bad people" opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum," he said in an address to the nation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and injured dozens.</seg>
<seg id="6">The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, one of the few bright spots in Thailand's economy.</seg>
<seg id="8">At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Whatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable," said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="10">These attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Photo Thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in Hua Hin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have portrayed the attacks as "local sabotage," not terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="14">The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most injuries occurred.</seg>
<seg id="17">The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.</seg>
<seg id="18">The junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bombings were "clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Last year, a bombing at the popular Erewan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tourists from China.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.</seg>
<seg id="23">General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week's bombings "hurt the hearts" of Thai people.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Why now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have to ask why, and who did it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia</seg>
<seg id="2">Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in Bogotá, leaving as his suicide note a Facebook post quoting Pink Floyd's "Goodbye Cruel World."</seg>
<seg id="3">His death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled Colombia this week, as the effort to expand L.G.B.T. rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation.</seg>
<seg id="4">After his death, Mr. Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year later, Colombia's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="6">The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia's gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="7">This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Parody quickly debunked that.</seg>
<seg id="10">While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts," Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group.</seg>
<seg id="13">A coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed, accusing the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity.</seg>
<seg id="14">To complicate matters, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an accord on gender and L.G.B.T. equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics.</seg>
<seg id="16">They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a tough stage and a very lonely time.</seg>
<seg id="20">She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students.</seg>
<seg id="21">As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark an seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day.</seg>
<seg id="24">"To me, it's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential," Ms. Parody said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing.</seg>

<seg id="2">A boy was injured when he fell from a roller coaster on Thursday and he was flown to a Pittsburgh hospital, emergency services and park officials said, in the third accident this week involving children hurt on U.S. amusement park rides.</seg>
<seg id="3">The child, whose identity were not released, was flown to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Idlewild and SoakZone theme park in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, a spokeswoman for Westmoreland County Emergency Services said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 3-year-old boy, who was on the ride with his brother, was conscious while being treated on site, park spokesman Jeff Croushore said in an email</seg>
<seg id="5">Croushore said the ride, known as Rollo Coaster, would be closed pending an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Idlewild requires children to be at least 3 feet (91 cm) tall to ride the roller coaster, and those shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ride was built in 1938, according to the park's website, and the state department of agriculture said it passed inspection in August.</seg>
<seg id="8">A hospital spokesman declined to comment on the boy's condition.</seg>
<seg id="9">A 10-year-old boy died on Sunday from a neck injury sustained while riding the world's tallest water slide in Kansas City, Kansas.</seg>

<seg id="3">However, Abe plans to send a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine to mark the anniversary on Monday, Jiji reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The shrine honors 14 Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals and is seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime militarism.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man under arrest since Monday as part of the investigation into the killing of a French priest last month has been placed under formal investigation, a police source told Reuters on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 21-year old suspect is under investigation for collaboration with terrorists and was planning attacks on people, the source said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The man had been in telephone contact with Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, who interrupted a church service in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, western France, on July 26, and slit the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Father Jacques Hamel.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both were shot dead by police.</seg>
<seg id="6">The suspect had traveled from his home town near Toulouse to Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young man, who has no criminal record, has acknowledged having spent the night there but told investigators that he had left the next day because he did not had a good relationship with Kermiche and Petitjean, the source said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Macy's to close 100 stores</seg>
<seg id="2">Department store giant Macy's said on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, it says, has too many stores for the online shopping era.</seg>
<seg id="3">Macy's regularly prunes its store portfolio, often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush.</seg>
<seg id="4">But in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations, the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a Macy's store in New York.</seg>
<seg id="6">The retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Macy's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change: Many of its stores are located in small, regional malls, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and fast-fashion players such as H&M to buy their clothes.</seg>
<seg id="9">These factors, along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather, have left Macy's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Thursday, the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter, a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter.</seg>
<seg id="11">The retailer's revenue was $US5.87 billion ($A7.64 billion), down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Macy's said the store closures would probably cost it about $US1 billion in annual sales.</seg>
<seg id="13">And at one time, such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer's concession of defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yet the company's stock soared 17 per cent on Thursday, a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for Macy's.</seg>
<seg id="15">In some ways, it should not come as a surprise that Macy's is slashing stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Terry Lundgren, the retailer's chief executive, has said before that the chain simply had too many stores.</seg>
<seg id="17">Executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores, trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jeff Gennette, the Macy's executive who has been appointed to replace Lundgren in 2017, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand," Gennette said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.</seg>
<seg id="21">Macy's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores, but will look to close stores that are in weak locations.</seg>
<seg id="23">The move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators, who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria?</seg>
<seg id="2">According to new research, drinking from refillable water bottle can be "many times worse than licking your dog's toy" in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with.</seg>
<seg id="3">The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top, slide-top, squeeze-top, and straw-top.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sq cm)," Treadmill Reviews said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Slide-top were found to have the highest germ content, with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq) cm on average.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bottles harboured gram-positive cocci, which can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="9">Squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 CFU/sq cm, and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 CFU/sq cm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet's dish," the site added.</seg>
<seg id="11">A far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles, which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 CFU/sq cm.</seg>
<seg id="12">This may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as "mostly harmless."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Based on our test results, we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle, both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs," the site said.</seg>
<seg id="15">We also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleach solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Religion must either modernise or face obsolescence</seg>
<seg id="2">In the United States the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="3">If the results of the latest polls hold true at election time, America will swear in its first female president in January.</seg>
<seg id="4">The previous week, across the pond, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from Europe with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="5">Women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.</seg>
<seg id="6">And young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership.</seg>
<seg id="7">So is the long and hard battle for women's equality finally over?</seg>
<seg id="8">Hillary Clinton is poised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sphere women's leadership is still a contentious issue.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, not entirely.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the religious sphere women's leadership remains a contentious issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week Pope Francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the Catholic Church.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Anglican Church consecrated Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the Jewish Reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s, and the Conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested.</seg>
<seg id="14">In November 2015, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for Orthodox women's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Not without irony, as Hillary Clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading American Orthodox rabbis opposed to women's ordination launched a series of "hearings" on this disputed subject.</seg>
<seg id="16">Why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred?</seg>
<seg id="17">Orthodox Judaism, like most religions, seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values.</seg>
<seg id="18">This finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who oppose women's ordination do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."</seg>
<seg id="20">But the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost.</seg>
<seg id="21">And the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant.</seg>
<seg id="22">In The Guns of August, a military history of the First World War, Barbara Tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the "tragedy of the red trousers."</seg>
<seg id="23">In the lead up to WWI, as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance, it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">The British and German armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns.</seg>
<seg id="25">The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red caps and trousers, marking them out as easy targets.</seg>
<seg id="26">The suggestion of the French war minister Adolphe Messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.</seg>
<seg id="28">At a parliamentary hearing, a former war minister, Eugene Etienne, spoke for France.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Eliminate the red trousers?" he cried.</seg>
<seg id="30">Never!</seg>
<seg id="31">"That blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours," wrote Messimy afterwards, "was to have cruel consequences."</seg>
<seg id="32">Faith leaders grappling with women's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall.</seg>
<seg id="33">By focusing exclusively on "what is traditional" for their religion rather than asking the crucial question: "What change is necessary for religion to thrive?" they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock.</seg>
<seg id="34">They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute.</seg>
<seg id="35">Insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional, but, as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates, it may not be worth the price.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children from Rojas County learn new skills at camp.</seg>
<seg id="2">From August 1 to 6 at Rojupe Children and Youth Centre took place a camp called "Rainbow bridges", during which the participants were able to creatively express themselves, participate in sporting activities and learn new skills.</seg>
<seg id="3">We arrived at the camp on its last day, when the children were having fun painting glass jars.</seg>
<seg id="4">Māra Folkmane, Specialist on Youth Affairs of Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre, told us that this was one of the activities that the children enjoyed the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">They also enjoyed their visit to Einārs Kalniņš' carpenter’s shop "Mazbebriņi".</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of all the children enjoyed the laser engraver, and seeing how a computer slowly applies the original design onto a wooden board.</seg>
<seg id="7">E. Kalniņš talked about what subjects you need to study at school, if you want to work in carpentry, namely, mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing.</seg>
<seg id="8">He also pointed out the fact that this profession is more about working with your brain, than with your muscles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The small workshop receives individual orders, and it is important to plan everything out first.</seg>
<seg id="10">To get to know each other better, at the beginning of the camp, the participants took part in different games, as well as creating a "coat of arms" together for the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Wednesday there was held a hike along the sea from Roja to Žocene, along the way were collected natural materials, which were later used for card making.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were also organised sports games, which were especially important to the participants.</seg>
<seg id="13">We went to apartment buildings, where we have a sports and recreation ground, to play football and volleyball.</seg>
<seg id="14">The children love sports activities. We have many boys who play football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sporty to do.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girls generally enjoy more peaceful activities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another day, a nurse helped us to decorate jars, which can be later used as pencil holders.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was also a talent evening, when children themselves chose who to perform with, with the whole evening devoted to performances.</seg>
<seg id="18">They also played board games, and everybody could prove their knowledge during photo orienteering, where you have to use a photo as a clue to find an object, and then take a picture of yourself with it.</seg>
<seg id="19">The task was to pose differently in every picture.</seg>
<seg id="20">We also coloured mandalas - some enjoyed that more than others did.</seg>
<seg id="21">There will never be one activity that appeals to everybody - one loves sport, another loves creative activities.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Now it seems to me that everyone is getting excited about painting glass", explained M. Folkmane.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the closing of the camp children were awarded with diplomas for creativity, sportiness, and helpfulness - a number of children helped with the running of the camp and chores.</seg>
<seg id="24">The camp "Rainbow bridges" was established due to the participation of children from three associations - Rojupes and Melnsila child and youth initiatives centre, as well as Rojas county multifunctional centre "Hive".</seg>
<seg id="25">They are one now unified group.</seg>
<seg id="26">If the Rojena team invents something faster, we borrow ideas from them; if the contrary, then they borrow from us.</seg>
<seg id="27">We share our experiences.</seg>
<seg id="28">This year, the camp involved 30 participants - children who have participated in different activities during the year.</seg>
<seg id="29">We had already anticipated that there would be 30, and that turned out to be the case", said Mr Folkmane.</seg>
<seg id="30">The camp was held for the fifth year.</seg>
<seg id="31">It dates back to 2010, when Rojas county social service decided that large families and children from poor families needed summer camps to be organised.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the meantime the situation in Roja has improved, and now the camp is intended for residents of the county, who come and work in the youth centres.</seg>
<seg id="33">The aim is for the kids to spend their free time in a meaningful and interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="34">Previously two camps were held, each with 20 children, while at the moment due to the fact that the country as a whole has a decreasing number of children, only one camp has needed to be held.</seg>
<seg id="35">Similar activities are organised for the rest of the year.</seg>
<seg id="36">Children draw, paint glass, and attended a demonstration by Einars Kalnins, who taught wood engraving, how to build machines from wood, and how to cut different shapes with jigsaws.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was also a new technique - encaustic painting, which is painting with hot wax chalk.</seg>
<seg id="38">Teacher Ilze Selkova showed how to use polymer materials, creating pendants and various dishes.</seg>
<seg id="39">They also made paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseed, and autumn leaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">We try to use materials that we can find around us.</seg>
<seg id="41">The youth centre is open in winter from 15.00 to 20.00, in the summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In Rude an average of 15 children a day attend the youth centres", says Mr Folkmane.</seg>
<seg id="43">He emphasises that the majority of support comes from Rojas County Council, who understand the need to allocate funds for children, because they are our future.</seg>

<seg id="10">Cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as Croatia might not fit everyone's idea of luxury, but north Dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south, our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike.</seg>
<seg id="11">The luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week, the brand new Melody.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides Ivan and Ivana to stow, and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins, sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that Croatians call a beach.</seg>
<seg id="13">In late June the sea is a perfect temperature, all agree: cool enough to refresh, but not cold.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have made our beds, restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ivan says stretching is important after cycling, and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with Antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Melody, at 42m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates, is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser.</seg>
<seg id="18">She turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to her.</seg>
<seg id="19">Colleen and Patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from Washington DC: the Over 45 Sport and Socials, they call themselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Last year's barge and bike holiday in the Netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="21">A rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive Facebook postings.</seg>
<seg id="22">The adventure element of the holiday can be overstated, because our schedule is nothing if not regimented.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Breakfast and dinner are at eight o'clock," Ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split.</seg>
<seg id="24">One ring of the ship's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Good moaning!" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British contingent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast, while Ivana hands out sketch maps of the day's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles, contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.</seg>
<seg id="28">Completely flat is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text, switching fluently between English and German.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with, but we are an easy group - Swiss, German, American and British - which divides easily at mealtimes into two English speaking tables, one German.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the road we are all friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">Cycling breeds camaraderie, and the only competition is with the terrain, which is to say ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">I can't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="34">We soon tune in to Ivan's wave length.</seg>
<seg id="35">A stiff climb is an incline, not to be confused with an undulation, which is a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on: simple but not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="37">Cycling instructions are always the same: "Single file, keep your distance, and it's not a race.</seg>
<seg id="38">We meet on the quay at nine.</seg>
<seg id="39">OK, five past - you're on holiday, I forgot.</seg>
<seg id="40">Take lots of water.</seg>
<seg id="41">From Trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the Kornati archipelago, where we ride most of the length of Dugi Otok - Croatian for "long island" - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the Telašćica Nature Park, to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we paddle, will our legs feel younger and stronger?</seg>
<seg id="44">At the small island of Molat we turn south again, hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion.</seg>
<seg id="45">Most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg: olive groves, vineyards, prickly herbal scrub; Mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing.</seg>
<seg id="46">While we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when Ivan calls a halt, and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Sport and Socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette, sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely.</seg>
<seg id="48">"You were nearly a hood ornament there," one cyclist tells another, after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard.</seg>
<seg id="49">Fortunately they worked.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads, with Ivana at the very back to encourage and "scoop up," as Ivan puts it.</seg>
<seg id="51">And if a main road must be crossed we all assemble, dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side, as instructed and not before.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Do you think Ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children?" a Swiss cyclist asks, as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross.</seg>
<seg id="53">Our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness.</seg>
<seg id="54">A city tour at Zadar reveals remains of a Roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster, through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water.</seg>
<seg id="55">Zadar's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="56">When Melody sets sail for the lively resort of Biograd in the early morning, the organ's song is no more than a whisper.</seg>
<seg id="57">Day five is entirely free of cycling.</seg>
<seg id="58">A boat trip up the Krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Sibenik with its domed cathedral, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local speciality, coral - make for an interesting day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks</seg>
<seg id="2">People gather during the annual Catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of Notre Dame de Lourdes.</seg>
<seg id="3">French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics converge on the shrine of Lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each year, tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the Pyrenees for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, marking the ascent of the Virgin Mary into Heaven.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year's pilgrimage comes as Catholics reel from the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamist extremists, who stormed his church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jacques Hamel's murder came under two weeks after a Tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many in France are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="8">With tourist arrivals in the country plummeting, authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage would be sharply down.</seg>
<seg id="9">But fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around 25,000 faithful are expected, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many pilgrims say they will not be cowed.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're not going to stop living," Christian, a 66-year-old visitor, told AFP, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the face of violence.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's important to show that life goes on," said Matthieu Guignard, one of the coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith, our beliefs, our way of living.</seg>
<seg id="15">Several major events have been cancelled in France since the Nice attack over security concerns, including a huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European road cycling championships that had been set to take place in Nice in September.</seg>
<seg id="16">"For the past week, my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations," Fabien Lejeusne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful, he said, reporting a last-minute bookings spurt.</seg>
<seg id="18">The head of the local hotel workers' union, Christian Gelis, confirmed signs of "increased interest" in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to Bernadette Soubirous, a poor shepherd girl, in 1858.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around 250 police and two dozen soldiers, including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs, have been deployed to protect the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three.</seg>
<seg id="22">Catherine Simcox, who made a pilgrimage from the north east of England to Lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security.</seg>
<seg id="23">"By Thursday morning, there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal barriers) with bags being searched on the way in," she told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This total freaked my three kids out who are used to Lourdes & it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't spoil my experience, but it saddened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reassured by the measures.</seg>
<seg id="26">The route of Friday's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of Lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary, it will start and end at the shrine.</seg>
<seg id="27">Other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above Lourdes to flights, closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags.</seg>
<seg id="28">Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="29">Lourdes attracts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Catholic pilgrimage in the world.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives, who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where Bernadette said she saw Mary, believing the water to have healing properties.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thierry Castillo, another of the organisers, described this year's gathering as "a bit unusual" given "the threat that seems to have taken root in France."</seg>
<seg id="32">But "it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experience," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="33">Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims, admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues "a little overwhelming."</seg>
<seg id="34">But if it reassures everyone, it's good.</seg>

<seg id="1">The opening of the waterfowl hunting season is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="2">Every year, the second Saturday of August is the opening for the waterfowl hunting season.</seg>
<seg id="3">This year it starts on August 13th at16:00, so the State Police calls for both the hunters and citizens to be especially careful and follow safety rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Waterfowl hunting takes place not only in hunting areas, but also around public bodies of water, and while the weather does not promise burning heat as in other years, it is accepted that both vacationers and hunters will use these bodies of water.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both hunters and vacationers and people who live near by are called to be particularly vigilant of lakes and rivers and follow safety rules, so as not to endanger themselves or others.</seg>
<seg id="6">As in previous years, it has been observed that in the first days of the season opening, waterfowl hunters engage in a large number, so this year the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will strengthen their control of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Law enforcers will focus attention on controlling the movement of arms and ammunition in compliance with the provisions of the Law, as well as monitoring that no one uses alcohol or becomes intoxicated during hunting.</seg>
<seg id="8">Police recalls when hunting waterfowl, it is prohibited to use semi-automatic guns, with cartridge chambers and magasines of a total capacity of more than three rounds, and draw attention to the amendments of the movement of weapons and special tools law, in particular Article 22 (91) part of which states that persons with long firearms or high-power pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sports, and short stop time of up to two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, have the right during hunting to store guns and ammunition in the vehicle, but they must be placed in the safest possible case or other package containing the ammunition or weapon, which is not visible from outside the vehicle, located behind a locked door and equipped with an alarm device, thus ensuring that they are not accidentally placed in the hands of unauthorised persons.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police call for respect of the safety and the security of fellow citizens in the hunting season, and if you see any violations of the law or any threat to security, to call 110 immediately to make a report.</seg>
<seg id="10">In any event of danger, law enforcers are ready to respond to the information provided by residents</seg>

<seg id="2">On Friday the New Caledonia coast shook with a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, seismologists said, pointing out that there is no threat from a tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="3">The epicenter of the earthquake was at a depth of nine-kilometers, 109 kilometers to the east of New Caledonia in Ilantera at1.26 am Greenwich time4.26 Latvia time, informed the US Geological Survey research centre.</seg>

<seg id="5">"Earthquakes in this region, as we know, are not unusual, and this kind of activity in recent times is not unusual", said the "Geoscience Australia" research centre senior seismologist Phil Kamins.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world's most used social network Facebook has broadcast a warning shot, leading to believe that ad-blocking, by using special tools, it is not acceptable and all users are going to have to watch advertising.</seg>
<seg id="3">Special ad blocker popularity is growing, but it means that companies, whose main source of income is from advertising, are suffering from decreased revenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Facebook acknowledges that advertising can be annoying, but expresses that users will have to learn to live with them anyway.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, they will be provided with tools to be able to choose themselves what type of materials appear, reports the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"As people have more options for control, we'll start sending ads to those using ad-blocking software," said Facebook advertising business vice president Andrew Bosworth.</seg>
<seg id="7">In other words, users will be able to choose what type of ads they see by selecting the brands and the sectors that they find interesting.</seg>
<seg id="8">"People do not like to see ads that they are not interested in or that interfere with their enjoyment of content," added Bosworth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ad blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, of which Facebook has the largest attendance, but the resulting banner exposure reduction just in terms of money is measured in billions.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to BBC information, advertising blockers are used by about 200 million people.</seg>
<seg id="11">As reported in the previous business year quarter Facebook advertising revenues were 6.2 billion US dollars or 5.55 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">It should be noted that this is not the first time that Facebook has been actively involved in determining what network users see in their news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="13">As one of the last steps Facebook has just started to take action to remove from news feeds, or at least limit "loud" titles, behind which actually lie "empty" messages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Latvian has a problem with quality automotive purchasing development, said Auto Association Vice president Ingus Rutins in an interview with the news agency BNS .</seg>
<seg id="2">When asked whether the auto purchasing industry has noticeable problems with dumping prices, Rutins answered in the affirmative.</seg>
<seg id="3">But of course.</seg>
<seg id="4">Automobile purchases are distinct from purchasing of maintenance services, where prices are easier to manipulate.</seg>
<seg id="5">With cars you have to pay a fixed amount, as you are obliged to buy them from the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nevertheless, there is a problem here, which can be divided into two parts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Either the purchase announcer is incompetent and does not know how to create a high-quality purchase, and as a result is often unknowingly, "shopped".</seg>
<seg id="8">"Or very conscious procurement is carried out, in order to receive something concrete, and then all kinds of miracles can be witnessed", stated the Auto association Vice president.</seg>
<seg id="9">He noted that currently it is popular to talk about moving away from the lowest bid on the most economically advantageous tender as procurement criteria for determining the winner, but the public still have false ideas about these kinds of issues.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is very popular - let's move away from the lowest prices towards the most economically advantageous offer!</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the criteria should be established in both cases, and when they are taken into account and evaluated, the decision is taken at the principle of the lowest price.</seg>
<seg id="12">Technical criteria for qualitative procurement should be very accurate and relevant to the market.</seg>
<seg id="13">In turn, the points do not need to judge anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.</seg>
<seg id="14">You do not need to use points to evaluate fuel consumption, emissions, maintenance services and similar things.</seg>
<seg id="15">You need to know the car life cycle, mileage, etc., then you can easily assess the overall picture.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The question then is just about which of the scenarios the client themselves interested in?" explained Rutins.</seg>
<seg id="17">In turn, the Auto association project manager Peter Rubulis noted that the problems are related to the fact that often one and the same person makes purchases for cars, as well as for work gloves, and food and these purchases are derived from the same sample.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have brought to the consultation also purchasing of sample spare parts which otherwise was difficult to name as an absurd example.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The problem is that the procurement compiler very often lacks any understanding of the subject of procurement and simply copies the requirements from somewhere", admitted Rubulis.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rutins added - the smaller the structure, which announces the procurement, the greater the problems they tend to have.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Apparently it is precisely because of the lack of human resources and expertise," said the Vice president of the association.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turkey seeks missing diplomats following coup attempt</seg>
<seg id="2">Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats who failed to return to Turkey in a recall of personnel following a July 15 coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Friday that 208 members of Turkey's ministry staff were recalled to Ankara from posts around the world in an inquiry regarding the coup attempt, and 32 remain missing "without permission."</seg>
<seg id="4">About 18,000 civil servants, military leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended from their positions in Turkey, the government believing their loyalties lie with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of masterminding the attempt to overthrow the government.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's most-wanted list.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cavosoglu said a U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issue has become a problem for the United States in its dealings with Turkey, a NATO member.</seg>
<seg id="8">The United States has objected to the strong-arm tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup, and Turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cavosoglu said two Turkish military attaches in Greece fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia but was sent back and two generals in Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">He added two civil servants in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one in Russia went to Japan.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, added Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also missing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official familiar with the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer stationed at a Virginia NATO command center requested asylum in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are those who have escaped.</seg>
<seg id="14">There have been escapees among our diplomats as well," Cavosoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of yesterday, time has run out for those initially called back.</seg>
<seg id="16">We will carry out the legal operations for those who have not returned.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool</seg>
<seg id="2">Olympic divers planning to practice Friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The water suddenly changed color Tuesday, midway through the synchronized diving events.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials insisted the water was safe for competing, even after a larger, adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green.</seg>
<seg id="5">The diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups, though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the start of the women's 3-meter event.</seg>
<seg id="6">The water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green.</seg>
<seg id="7">American diver Abby Johnston, who is competing on the springboard, said she showed up for her warmup, only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp" should start trending.</seg>
<seg id="9">British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in the synchro platform event, also commented on the state of the pool in a Twitter post.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hopefully that means we haven't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days!</seg>
<seg id="11">Mario Andrada, chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for competition, clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries.</seg>
<seg id="12">He conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the first day of this water situation, one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy.</seg>
<seg id="15">This was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="16">We reduced immediately the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="17">We retested the water and it was totally within the parameters.</seg>
<seg id="18">Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the decision was supported by world governing body FINA.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool's deteriorating condition.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some things, as you can see, went longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The rain doesn't help," Andrada said.</seg>
<seg id="26">He added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning, but conceded that "was not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="27">He explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels, much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly.</seg>
<seg id="28">When we went to fix the green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.</seg>
<seg id="29">We can't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.</seg>
<seg id="30">We certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green.</seg>
<seg id="31">Once it turned green, we again made another bit of a mistake.</seg>

<seg id="2">Shanghai and Taipei will hold their annual city forum from Aug. 22-23 in Taipei, Shanghai municipal authorities announced Friday, despite current suspension of cross-Strait communication mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senior municipal official Sha Hailin, on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong, will lead a delegation to attend the forum, the Shanghai government announced via its official microblog account on Sina Weibo.</seg>
<seg id="4">The forum has been held by the two cities in rotation since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 2016 forum will focus on exchanges in fields such as health care, smart cities, culture and transportation in a bid to "deepen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, according to the Shanghai government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Taiwan side has failed to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which endorses the one-China principle, since new leader Tsai Ing-wen assumed office in May, leading to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office on the mainland, said Friday that the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations can be maintained as long as the Taiwan side adheres to the political foundation of the 1992 Consensus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We hold an active and open attitude toward exchanges between cities of both sides," Ma said, stressing that the nature of cross-Strait relations and city exchanges should be interpreted correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and wished for closer cooperation while meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</seg>
<seg id="3">China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who has sided with Africa during the continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development, Museveni said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The president cited the Tanzania-Zambia Railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of China's generous support even when China was by then not so prosperous itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">China has carried out multifaceted cooperation with Uganda, ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges, Museveni said, adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to Uganda's long-term development than simply providing aids.</seg>
<seg id="6">He hopes China can, through various ways, join in Uganda's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also welcomes more Chinese to invest and travel in Uganda.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wang Yi hailed the progress Uganda has made in industrialization and agricultural modernization, adding that China will continue to play the role of Uganda's most reliable and ideal cooperation partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">China stands ready to try its best in helping Uganda pursue economic and social development, Wang said, noting that Sino-Ugandan cooperation is sincere and without any political strings attached as it is based on high-level political trust and time-tested friendship.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda on construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, and support the east African nation to develop its energy and agriculture sectors.</seg>
