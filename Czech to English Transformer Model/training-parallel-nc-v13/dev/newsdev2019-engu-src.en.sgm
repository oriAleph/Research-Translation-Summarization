<seg id="1">When will we open the doors to our temples for the women having periods?</seg>
<seg id="2">My newly wedded friend told me almost two weeks ago that she was preparing for the first Trij festival of her life.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trij is basically a festival celebrated in North India where a woman prays for happy married life.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Trij festival, the married woman fasts the whole day and worships at night.</seg>
<seg id="5">While talking to me, my friend was quite eager and happy.</seg>
<seg id="6">She had also bought a new sari to wear on Trij and even put mehendi on both her hands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even I was very glad to see her. But in the morning of the Trij festival, she got her period.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that her mother and mother-in-law both forbade her from fasting and worship.</seg>
<seg id="9">The other women of the household also advised my friend to stay away from the worship room, telling her she should not touch anything used in prayers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Other women keeping the fast of Trij were advised to stay away from my friend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Periods and entry to the home temple</seg>
<seg id="12">After the incident, when my friend called me and talked as she cried, I felt as if someone had stabbed me in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="13">I thought about her eagerness and the preparation for the Trij festival.</seg>
<seg id="14">I looked at the picture of her mehendi on WhatsApp once more and even my eyes were wet.</seg>
<seg id="15">I angrily told her that along with the Trij festival she should have also left that religion which instead of awakening the feelings of love and kindness, deciding on whether she should enter the temple during periods or not.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the news of the Supreme Court's order dismissing the restriction on entry of women in Sabrimala temple was being flashed on numerous TV screens, I remembered this incident of my friend and her Trij festival in Bhopal.</seg>
<seg id="17">What was the Sabrimala issue?</seg>
<seg id="18">Until now 10 to 50 year old women were not allowed to enter the temple of Sabrimala in Kerala.</seg>
<seg id="19">The temple, which is considered one of the main pilgrimage centres of India has had this ban for hundreds of years.</seg>
<seg id="20">The reason behind this discrimination was the temple's logic that Lord Ayappa had remained unmarried throughout their life.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hence women who could get their period cannot go and worship there.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Indian Young Lawyers Association challenged the ban of the temple by registering a petition in the public interest in 2006 in the supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="23">After hearing the arguments from both the parties for 12 years, the five member constitutional benches of the supreme court gave its verdict on 28th September, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="24">What did the Supreme court say?</seg>
<seg id="25">Chief Justice Deepal Mishra, Justice R.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nariamn, Justice A.M.</seg>
<seg id="27">Khanwilkar and Justice Chandrachud of the constitutional bench of supreme court said that the ban on women's entry into the temple was a violation of Article 14 of the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="28">The bench mentioned, "without discrimination, anyone should be allowed to worship in the temple."</seg>
<seg id="29">The fifth and the only woman in this constitutional bench, Justice Indu Malhotra expressed dissatisfaction with the decision of the other four judges and the court gave the above verdict at 4-1.</seg>
<seg id="30">Irrational blind faith</seg>
<seg id="31">While reading about the court's verdict, I was thinking of my niece.</seg>
<seg id="32">My teenage niece started getting her periods about two days ago.</seg>
<seg id="33">Once in a panic, she told me that when she had her periods, her grandmother had forbidden her from entering the room where they kept the temple.</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, she was also forbidden from entering the kitchen and touching the pickle jars.</seg>
<seg id="35">My niece said, "that day her mum had made her favourite curry."</seg>
<seg id="36">She was so hungry that she forgot about her periods.</seg>
<seg id="37">And ran to the kitchen to get the curry.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Later the grandmother scolded my mum." With this my niece questioned me why such rituals?</seg>
<seg id="39">I didn't have any answer to her question.</seg>
<seg id="40">Like my niece, many teenagers growing up in Indian households are asking for the answer from us.</seg>
<seg id="41">The question is that the supreme court has lifted the ban on women's entry into Sabrimala but when will we remove the irrational faith from our minds?</seg>
<seg id="42">When will we open the gates of our house temple, kitchen and heart for the women with their monthly?</seg>
<seg id="43">Periods are a normal process associated with reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="44">How can the process that has created the world and is the reason behind our existence be impure?</seg>
<seg id="45">If a woman is unclean for these five days of the month, we must end such a measure of purity.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Supreme court has stood with us going against the whole world, but the question is, that as a society, when will we stand with the other half of our population?</seg>

<seg id="1">Rolling with the Ulster Lambretta Club</seg>
<seg id="2">Lambrettas were an essential accessory in the mod scene of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="3">The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts of the Italian motor scooter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 100 scooters from all over the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh this weekend, 70 years after the first Ulster Lambretta Club was formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chris Wilson, one of two members of the original club, bought his first Lambretta for around £40 in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="6">"A scooter was just to me a form of transport, but then there was the option to use it for other things.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bit of sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">I never did get into the mod scene and I'm probably far too old now for it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Basically it was relatively cheap, relatively reliable and they were available for the right amount of money and once you had one there were other things you could do with it other than just riding from A to B."</seg>
<seg id="10">He used to race Lambrettas in time trials around the TT circuit on the Isle of Man.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first Ulster Lambretta Club wound up in the early 1970s but it was reformed 12 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It started to die out around 1971, the interest in scooters, other forms of transport and the Troubles didn't help with clubs in general, so I thought, 'No that's it, finished'," Chris said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And then sometime back there were showings of the interest in it and it seems to have grown and grown."</seg>
<seg id="14">Philip Steele is the membership secretary of the Ulster Lambretta Club which currently has 97 members.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Everyone's got their own take.</seg>
<seg id="16">Obviously there'll be guys influenced from the whole mod scene, that's where a lot of it started.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other guys are into the racing scene, rockers, there's a mixture of everyone in it here.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people are just into the vintage thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same.</seg>
<seg id="20">You can either keep them original and potter along at 35 or 40 mph they were originally designed to go around the small streets in Italy, but some of the guys have tuned these things.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of these bikes here probably could do upwards of 100 mph, the super tuned ones. "</seg>
<seg id="22">There were a few breakdowns and push starts over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="23">And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as the Lambretta's Italian home, the sun was shining as the scooters toured around County Fermanagh.</seg>

<seg id="7">The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one."</seg>
<seg id="10">Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="11">Theresa May later insisted she did believe in Brexit, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 "the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event."</seg>
<seg id="13">Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: "In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for."</seg>

<seg id="1">Christine Blasey Ford's friend clarifies statement about alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh</seg>
<seg id="2">Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while they were both teenagers, has written a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee to clarify that although she does not remember the house party where the misconduct allegedly occurred, she believes Ford's account.</seg>
<seg id="3">Keyser had previously released a statement through her attorney saying that she did not remember the party in question, and that she does not remember ever meeting Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee Thursday, Kavanaugh often brought up Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, although he omitted that Keyser said that she believed Ford.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Trump instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation within one week on Friday, after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and other moderate senators called for a weeklong delay on a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation to give time for an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Keyser said through her lawyer in a letter to the committee that she was willing to "cooperate fully with the FBI's supplemental investigation" into Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="7">"However, as my client has already made clear, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford," the letter from Howard Walsh, Keyser's attorney, said.</seg>
<seg id="8">It continued that Keyser "does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account."</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question," the letter continued.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh's who was allegedly present during the assault, has also said that he will cooperate with the FBI investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wrongfully convicted Chicago residents recall life under corrupt cop and his "gang"</seg>
<seg id="2">The top prosecutor in Illinois is trying to turn the page from a dark period in Chicago police history.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's believed that one bad cop preyed on innocent residents of a housing project, rounding up dozens of people on bogus charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">So far, 42 wrongly convicted people have been exonerated.</seg>
<seg id="5">An empty lot is now all that's left of the Ida B. Wells housing project where a group of corrupt Chicago cops preyed almost risk-free on residents for most of a decade.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sergeant Ronald Watts was their ringleader.</seg>
<seg id="7">Residents have accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, filing false police reports, planting evidence and assault.</seg>
<seg id="8">Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those exonerated so far by Cook County state attorney Kim Foxx.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If you didn't cooperate with him, you was going down.</seg>
<seg id="10">You was against him.</seg>
<seg id="11">You was against his operation and his way of getting money," Cleon Glover said of Watts.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I was terrified.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was trying to get away, get out of that neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="14">I had nowhere to go," Willie Martin said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lawyers from Foxx's conviction integrity unit are reviewing 30 to 40 additional cases connected to Watts.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ida B. Wells housing resident Landon Allen said a lot of people spoke up about Watts.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Everybody spoke up," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"But it didn't matter."</seg>
<seg id="19">As Clarissa Baker, another former resident, pointed out, it was their word against a sergeant with a badge.</seg>
<seg id="20">"He has his own gang.</seg>
<seg id="21">So who would believe us?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Baker said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Joshua Tepfer of the University of Chicago's exoneration project says the answer until recently was no one.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They let it go on because they viewed these people as disposable and they didn't care because they're black people in the housing projects who in their minds were guilty of something anyway," Tepfer said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Sgt. Watts went to prison in 2013 and served 22 months for trying to steal from an FBI informant.</seg>
<seg id="26">Martez Wise went to prison too - because of Watts.</seg>
<seg id="27">During that time I had just had my son.</seg>
<seg id="28">I was away from him for four years.</seg>
<seg id="29">He barely even know who I was because he was just born, so I had to re-bond with him," Wise said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Four years taken away for nothing."</seg>

<seg id="1">72-year-old Fidelity bets on the future with blockchain, virtual reality and AI</seg>
<seg id="2">Fidelity recognized the potential in blockchain before it became the corporate buzzword of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="3">CEO Abby Johnson led the charge into cryptocurrency, one of the riskiest and most volatile asset classes of the past year.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A few plus years ago, myself and a few other senior executives here were just curious about what was going on, particularly with bitcoin," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="5">We started getting together to say 'we're got to understand this.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The curiosity led them to start bitcoin "mining," at a location in New Hampshire when the crypto's price was around $180.</seg>
<seg id="7">Flash forward to December of last year when bitcoin rose to almost $20,000, "behold - the price goes up and all the sudden we're making money, which was never the intent," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She did not specify how much bitcoin has been mined, or how much money Fidelity made.</seg>
<seg id="9">There's clear interest in the topic by Fidelity employees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Its blockchain club for employees called "bits and blocks," hosts seminars, office hours and meet ups, now has roughly 2,600 members.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company has an arrangement with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity mobile app.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2015, it started facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many other potential uses for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been scrapped by now or "put on the shelf," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">We're trying to listen to the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the meantime, Katie Chase, the head of strategy for Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and head of the Blockchain Incubator (which is a part of FCAT), is exploring uses for both public blockchain and enterprise blockchain.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chase could not comment specifically on the projects but said she's seen massive interest from clients and partners, as well as their own employees.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's still very nascent.</seg>
<seg id="18">All of the stuff that you're reading about, if you dig under the covers is still in the proof of concept stage," Chase said.</seg>
<seg id="19">We tried to apply blockchain to some use cases where we learned a lot but the technology isn't mature enough to solve these problems."</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, the group is more focused on what some of those barriers are, she said.</seg>
<seg id="21">They're looking at how to "tokenize" physical items, like a piece of art for example, or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Those are on the shelf, but we think they'll eventually come off," Chase said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Fidelity will be well-equipped when they do."</seg>
<seg id="24">She used the example of Pebble watch, a failure by retail standards but something that paid off for Fidelity.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her group had created an app for the smartwatch, which shut down three years after raising millions through a crowdfunded kickstarter campaign.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the Apple Watch finally came to market, Fidelity was ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">It used the app developed for Pebble to quickly go live on Apple's new product.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We were not betting that the Pebble watch is the next big thing - but in case we have people wearing these things on their wrist, we wanted to be there too," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It gave us the learning for when the smart watch did go to mass market, and we were able to be there."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Escondido Union High School District this week confirmed that about 10 students at a senior event "made a poor decision" by participating in the stunt involving the racial slur, CNN affiliate KGTV reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We are a campus that prides itself on inclusion and embraces diversity," Principal Adriana Lepe-Ramirez said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will not tolerate actions that send messages of racism and promote divisiveness."</seg>
<seg id="5">The statement said Escondido High School, district officials and local police were investigating the incident, the station reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Parents and guardians of the students involved are being contacted by school administrators, and appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken," the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="7">During the senior picnic, students at the school north of San Diego wear lettered shirts and are photographed spelling out words while standing side by side, the station reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">The words are usually approved ahead of time but some students spell out their own words after the official photo is taken.</seg>
<seg id="9">The district statement said the activity was "not aligned with Escondido High School's culture, values or history."</seg>
<seg id="10">"We all need to understand the power of our words and actions, and we must take responsibility for the decisions we make each and every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At Escondido High School we will continue to work every day to build a culture of family and unity across our community."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cade Pannell, a former student who saw the offensive photo on social media, told KGTV the image made him angry.</seg>

<seg id="2">Track Palin, 28, was arrested on three charges, including assault</seg>
<seg id="3">Sunday's incident is not his first arrest related to domestic violence</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened at the Palin home in Wasilla, Alaska, where Track Palin bloodied his father, Todd, in a dispute over a truck, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 28-year-old was arrested on three charges, including assault, after the incident Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The dispute began when he called to say he wanted to come get the truck, and his father refused, according to court documents.</seg>
<seg id="7">Track Palin was arrested on charges of first-degree burglary, fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal mischief, and his father suffered injuries to his face and head, the court filing shows.</seg>
<seg id="8">Track Palin called the officers on the scene "peasants" and told them to abandon their weapons when they attempted to communicate with him, the documents say.</seg>
<seg id="9">At one point, he got onto the garage roof before eventually being detained, the court filing says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sarah Palin said her son was "freaking out" and "was on some type of medication," according to the court documents.</seg>
<seg id="11">Track Palin also told the police he had consumed a few beers earlier, the documents say.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence assault involving a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," the former Republican vice presidential candidate and governor of Alaska said at the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Third mystery death is linked to celebrity mental health clinic in less than a year</seg>
<seg id="2">An exclusive private psychiatric hospital is believed to have suffered a third suicide in less than a year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shaquelle Vidal, 23, the daughter of a TV comedian, died on April 7 after spending almost a month as a "voluntary" patient at the Nightingale Hospital in Marylebone, West London.</seg>
<seg id="4">She was the girlfriend of James Lyle, 57, a millionaire hedge fund boss and former Conservative Party donor, who met the five-figure cost for her care.</seg>
<seg id="5">The trainee chef's death came almost exactly six months after that of socialite and artist Daisy Boyd, 28, the granddaughter of River Cafe co-founder Rose Gray.</seg>
<seg id="6">Miss Boyd, who had struggled to deal with her split from publishing heir Dan Macmillan, 43, died on October 5 under the influence of cocaine smuggled in by a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months earlier, Alan MacDonald, 61, a film set designer, took his life four days after being discharged from the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, the Care Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale for doing too little to combat "illicit substances" being brought on to the premises.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shaquelle, the daughter of BBC's Mock The Week panellist Ava Vidal, went into the hospital on March 11.</seg>
<seg id="10">Katie Gollop QC told a pre-inquest hearing at Westminster Coroner's Court last week that she had gone "AWOL" on March 29 and when she returned a week later, her mental state had deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms Gollop, acting for Ava Vidal, said: "My client would like to piece together what was happening to Shaquelle... to understand who it was she was in contact with, and what she was doing."</seg>
<seg id="12">She referred to Mr Lyle as Shaquelle's "boyfriend."</seg>
<seg id="13">Comedy director John Gordillo, 52, who was described as Shaquelle's "unofficial stepfather," said: "I know Shaquelle was still in contact with James Lyle, and he was based in New York at the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Gordillo told the hearing that on April 4 he called the hospital "more than a dozen times" in 20 minutes after Shaquelle rang him to claim she wanted to buy and take cyanide, but that no one answered.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It seems to me that, had someone picked up during that period, what followed could have been avoided," he added.</seg>
<seg id="16">On April 5, a doctor at the hospital assessed Shaquelle as being "acutely psychiatrically unwell."</seg>
<seg id="17">Less than 48 hours later, she hanged herself using a laptop cable.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Nightingale spokesman extended sympathy to her family and friends and said: "Our hospital is committed to providing high standards of care in a safe and therapeutic environment."</seg>

<seg id="2">A Michigan man suspected of murdering his girlfriend has been arrested after leading police on a chase that ended when he was mowed down by a police car.</seg>
<seg id="3">Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected of shooting dead his girlfriend Tia Mae Randall, 27, Thursday in Wyoming, Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was arraigned Friday in a hospital where he is being treated after an officer ran him down with a police SUV as Nolin shot at them while trying to flee on a busy highway.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nolin has been charged with five felony counts including assault with intent to murder and fleeing police.</seg>
<seg id="6">'Arraigning at the hospital certainly isn't the norm, but it's not unheard of either,' Wyoming Police Capt. James Maguffee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">'He is getting the treatment he needs, but we need the wheels of justice to turn.</seg>
<seg id="8">Judges will often make the accommodations to make that happen.'</seg>
<seg id="9">The body of Nolin's girlfriend was found Thursday morning at Creekside Estates mobile home.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother-of-two was killed by a single gunshot and police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police then released an alert for the public to be on lookout for Nolin, giving a broad physical description of him and his 1996 black Dodge pickup truck.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was spotted in his trick and as police tried to pull him over Nolin hopped onto US 131.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nolin crashed his truck into a concrete median then got out and ran on foot down the highway.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he ran, Nolin shot at the officers chasing him.</seg>
<seg id="15">One cop took the police SUV and ran Nolin down from behind.</seg>
<seg id="16">The event was captured on video by an onlooker.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was transported to the hospital where he is in serious but stable condition and will remain until he is discharged and transferred to Kent County Jail.</seg>
<seg id="18">'It shows the willingness of our police officers in West Michigan to put themselves in harm's way to protect this community,' Maguffee said.</seg>
<seg id="19">'They got the guy in custody in an appropriate time frame and in an appropriate way and we're very proud of them.'</seg>
<seg id="20">In all, Nolin is charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder, fleeing police, carrying a concealed weapon and felony use of a firearm.</seg>
<seg id="21">He has yet to be charged in the death of his girlfriend as the homicide investigation remains active.</seg>
<seg id="22">'There's absolutely an underlying homicide investigation that continues and we'll be close to wrapping that up and we'll present that to the Kent County prosecutor at the appropriate time,' Maguffee said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge heaps praise on brave homeowner who knocked burglar's teeth out during break-in at his home</seg>
<seg id="2">A judge has praised a householder who confronted two thugs trying to break into his home - giving him "full marks" for bravery.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite one offender swinging a plank of wood at him, 63-year-old David Oldham refused to be cowed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead, the university estates manager fought back, punching both offenders and knocking one of the men's teeth out.</seg>
<seg id="5">The criminals fled but blood left on Mr Oldham from the scuffle led to one of them, Craig Ford, being identified and arrested four months later.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sentencing Ford, who lost a tooth after being hit by Mr Oldham outside his £400,000 detached home in Ormskirk, Lancashire, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, told him: "Mr Oldham gave you more than you bargained for because when he confronted you at the side of his house, disguised so only your eyes and nose were visible, he punched you.</seg>
<seg id="7">And not only did he punch you but when your accomplice, who had been breaking in upstairs, jumped down from the roof he punched him as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jailing Ford for three years and four months on Friday, the judge said: "You've learnt two lessons, I hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">One is you do not mess with David Oldham, and two, you don't mess with the police.</seg>
<seg id="10">For your pains in committing these offences you now have one tooth less than you had before and you got bitten by a dog.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the least you deserve."</seg>
<seg id="12">He added: "Full marks to Mr Oldham for the way in which he responded to what you did."</seg>
<seg id="13">Derek Jones, prosecuting, said that at the time of the burglary, Ford was on licence from a three-year sentence imposed in 2016, also for burglary.</seg>
<seg id="14">Liverpool Crown Court heard Mr Oldham sprang into action when he heard noises outside his home at about 7pm on April 5.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Jones said: "Mr Oldham, a man of some substance, bravely went out to the side of the property and was confronted by the defendant who moved towards him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fearing for his safety he punched him once to the face which knocked him to the floor and also knocked a tooth out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other intruder then jumped down from the roof landing in front of Mr Oldham who instinctively punched him to the face."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Jones said the accomplice picked up a plank of wood and swung it at Mr Oldham, and Ford said: "Shoot him, he's knocked my teeth out."</seg>
<seg id="19">The accomplice said to Mr Oldham: "We'll just leave it now if you let us go," and he and Ford fled the scene.</seg>
<seg id="20">Police caught up with Ford when they raided a house in Wavertree on August 2.</seg>

<seg id="1">Blow for Boris as Tory activists CLAP attack on him in conference hall</seg>
<seg id="2">Boris Johnson suffered a blow today as Tory activists clapped a vicious attack on him as 'irrelevant and offensive'.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite Mr Johnson wooing the grass roots with his hardline approach to Brexit, the brutal assessment from former trade minister Digby Jones went down well with members at conference in Birmingham this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, David Davis swiped that Mr Johnson was focused on 'headlines' rather than sound policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">And a Cabinet ally of Mrs May added to the woes by telling MailOnline that he was only making so much 'noise' because he did not have the 'numbers' for an all-out leadership bid.</seg>
<seg id="6">The backlash came after the former foreign secretary launched another vicious attack on the PM's Chequers plan for Brexit - branding it 'deranged' and 'preposterous'.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Johnson upped the ante by pointing out that she was a Remainer during the referendum two years ago - whereas he is a true believer in the project.</seg>
<seg id="8">And he urged the government to back ambitious projects like building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">But a defiant Mrs May shot back that her critics were 'playing politics' and insisted she is 'not bluffing' about driving a hard bargain with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="10">Speaking during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show to kick off Tory conference, Mrs May said: 'I do believe in Brexit.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Lord Jones, a former Labour trade minister who now sits as an independent, pleased the crowd by praising the opportunities of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he prompted applause by referring to alleged remarks by Mr Johnson when he responded 'f*** business' in response to questions about the concerns they have raised.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without naming Mr Johnson, Lord Jones took aim at the 'irrelevant and offensive person he really is'.</seg>
<seg id="14">'Business is so important that when I heard a former foreign secretary say "f*** business," it showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">'I take great exception to that.'</seg>
<seg id="16">Lord Jones also hailed the response by Mrs May - who watched the speech from the hall - to 'bullying' by EU leaders over her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also took aim at Mr Johnson, pointing out that he had stayed as a senior member of the government during the Brexit negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Cabinet ally of Mrs May played down the intervention, telling MailOnline that Mr Johnson does not have enough support among Tory MPs to oust the PM.</seg>
<seg id="19">They said: "It is not that damaging to have stories like this in the papers today.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is making a lot of noise, but Boris does not have the numbers in the parliamentary party, and he knows that is the case.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a big contrast between the respectful stance David Davis has taken, arguing his case, and the way Boris has pursued his own personal ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Business Secretary Greg Clark lashed Mr Johnson for attacking business for being sceptical about Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Speaking on the fringes of the Tory conference in Birmingham, Mr Clark said Mr Johnson's jibe was "totally the wrong thing to say."</seg>
<seg id="24">He said: "I was surprised that anyone could even think like that.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is no successful economy anywhere in the world that does not have successful and flourishing businesses.</seg>
<seg id="26">In an interview with Sky News' Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis admitted that the next couple of months would be 'really scary' as the EU tried to force deep concessions from the UK.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he said the government had to hold its nerve and push for a Canada-style agreement rather than Chequers.</seg>
<seg id="28">He also delivered a stinging barb when asked about Mr Johnson's attractions as a Tory leader.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ridiculing Mr Johnson's proposal of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said 'one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas'.</seg>
<seg id="30">He added: 'We have a very knockabout friendships, but quite a lot of his ideas are good headlines but not good policies.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Suspicious of the lion being ill, lion lovers are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rabarika round of the TulsiShyam Range, means a round without any protection.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Revenue region, known as the Mota Baramana Salwava, below the Raydi Pati Beat, a pair of 2 lions have stayed there a long time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both lions live together permanently and even hunted their prey together.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, since one lion disappeared two days ago, the forest department has been informed by local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="7">One lion has disappeared from the Raydi Pati Beat, avenue area, which falls below the Rabarika round of Tulsi Shyam range.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than 15 lions are living here in this range.</seg>
<seg id="9">In pairs of two lions, these lions, living in the Salva dhar area, are adults.</seg>
<seg id="10">Just four days before, these two lions had enjoyed a banquet of lamb near the substation of Mota Baraman village.</seg>
<seg id="11">The leftover lamb was moved to the protected place, not by the forest department but by the local people.</seg>

<seg id="16">The possibility of one of the lions likely to have a loose bowel motion is being discussed amongst local farmers</seg>

<seg id="18">Otherwise, there is any wonder if like the Dalkhiniyana range where the lions are dying like dogs, the event might repeat itself here too?</seg>
<seg id="19">Need to send samples to the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="20">An employee of the forest department on condition of remaining anonymous said that more than 15 lions are living in the Rabarika round of the Tulsi Shyam range.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their stools should be thick. Instead it is very thin.</seg>
<seg id="22">When the lions get diarrhoea and their body become impaired, as soon as possible, it is necessary to move the location of these lions and send these samples to the forensic lab to know why their stools are not thick</seg>

<seg id="7">According to the sources, at Sarsiya Vidi near Pavna Chakki, due to eating 14 sick goats, two cows and one dead buffalo infected with rabies, the lions are likely to have died due to serious viruses.</seg>
<seg id="8">Forest Department officials want to suppress the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">The corrupt officials of the forest department may try to cover this incident, even though there are some dutiful officers and employees too, who want to bring open the responsible forest department in this incident.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, these officers are kept away from the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">A virus entered the lions due to eating dead animals: forest officials</seg>
<seg id="12">A forest official on the condition of anonymity said that 7 lions' deaths are being shown as the in-fighting, while 16 others have died due to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">The lions who died due to the virus had consumed dead animals at Sarsiya Vidi.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the time the forest department was informed of this incident, the lions had already caught this virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it is difficult to determine how many lions ate this meat.</seg>
<seg id="16">Know more about the details of how the virus spread and how the bones of dead animals were removed.</seg>
<seg id="17">To save the lions, CDV antiviral vaccine was sent to the Rajkot from the US, it was then sent to Junagadh.</seg>
<seg id="18">Until the CBI or CID investigate, the truth won't be exposed.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the team from Delhi came, the bones of the dead animals were removed.</seg>
<seg id="20">At present, 30 lions have been caught and kept at Jasadhar Animal Care, and this incident is being diversified.</seg>
<seg id="21">The official further said that when the team of Delhi and Dehradun came to the spot, to cover the incident, a truck load of the bones of dead animals, near Pavna Chakki, was removed from the area.</seg>
<seg id="22">This work was done by the interstate laborers so that no one can knew about it. The fact is that the forest department is responsible somewhere behind this lions' deaths.</seg>
<seg id="23">We won't know the truth till the CBI or the CID investigation is done. A division official on condition of anonymity said that 28 days ago, at Pawanchalkki in Sarsiya Vidi, 14 dead diseased goats from Virpur village, 2 diseased cows of Govindpur and 1 buffalo infected with rabies from some village was placed here.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the dead lions, the virus was ingested by eating dead cattle in n Sarsiya Vidi.</seg>
<seg id="25">After eating dogs or other carnivorous animals, the virus spreads.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is true that this virus has spread after eating dog or other carnivorous animals, but in the sunlight, the saliva bacteria of the animal disappears only in seconds in the meat consumed by dogs or other animals.</seg>
<seg id="27">If a rogue dog has eaten a dead animal and a lion or a wild animal eat the same animal, this virus enters the lion or wild animal's body directly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ajab-Gajab Desk:- A couple in the Philippines was shocked when they saw their new born child, because the baby was born without a face.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is due to a rare type of physical disorder, which occurs to approximately one in 20,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">The child's parents say that this has happened due to the side effects of a drug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Knowing about the child, the father was in trauma, while the mother had lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Doctors did not expect that the child would live longer, although after all the problems, the child is still alive and recently they celebrated his first birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a story of Matthew Gillado, the one-year-old son of Raven and his wife Isabel, who live in the Philippines.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was born last year without a face.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was due to a rare type of physical disorder.</seg>
<seg id="9">Due to this illness, during pregnancy, the cranial vault bone lying in the skull did not form and his face could not form.</seg>
<seg id="10">After that, his face looks as if a bomb has exploded within his head.</seg>
<seg id="11">In July last year, when the child's mother, Isabel Gilado, went for the first ultrasound, after seeing the report, doctors thought that the unborn baby was less likely to survive.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, despite all the problems and the doubts of the doctors, he was born on 3rd October last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the couple, Isabel had a fever in the first month of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, she took a medicine called Bioflu for a week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Which is made up of phenylphrine HCI, chlorphaminamine and paracetamol.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parents think that this drug might have spoiled the face of the child.</seg>
<seg id="17">Because the face is not in a proper shape, there are a lot of problems in feeding the baby..</seg>
<seg id="18">He has to be fed drops of milk.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, it is necessary to give vitamin supplements to keep him healthy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The father was frightened after seeing the face of the child.</seg>
<seg id="21">Matthew was born in a Santiago hospital through an operation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The child's father says, "When I first saw our baby, I was frightened, I began to feel weak and almost fell in the delivery room."</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not have any face.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even after being born in this situation, Matthew was discharged from the hospital the next day while his mother Isabel had to stay in ICU for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raven says that we physically wanted to touch our baby, we wanted to kiss and hug it, so we named it Matthew.</seg>
<seg id="26">Which means "A gift received from God".</seg>
<seg id="27">The financial condition of the child's father is not very good.</seg>
<seg id="28">He works in a clothing factory in Quezon City and earns about 9 thousand rupees a month.</seg>
<seg id="29">Because of low earnings, Raven has to seek help from relatives and others to meet Matthew's needs.</seg>
<seg id="30">In May this year, Matthew was taken to a better hospital in Manila, where he remained admitted for approximately 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="31">During this time, after many tests, the doctors refused to do the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="32">They said that because of his weight being only 4.9 kg, his delicate constitution would not tolerate such major surgical operation.</seg>
<seg id="33">Doctors might have said anything, but the child's mother Isabel has not given up.</seg>
<seg id="34">She is confident that one day Matthew will be okay.</seg>
<seg id="35">Isabel says, "He is fighting for his life and we have also not lost hope."</seg>
<seg id="36">We are fighting and we are confident that one day, with God's grace and advanced medical assistance, I will see him with a good face.</seg>
<seg id="37">Read this too: - Maid was not taking proper care of his 2-year-old daughter; when the father kept CCTV in the house, he came to know about the horrible situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Antonin Scalia 'wouldn't be terribly surprised' by 'Mad Libs protesting' on Kavanaugh, son says</seg>
<seg id="2">The son of late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father wouldn't have been shocked by the partisan conflagration surrounding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, owing to what he called the improperly outsized power of the Supreme Court in modern life.</seg>
<seg id="3">"On a general level, he wouldn't be terribly surprised about the intensity surrounding this Supreme Court nomination, because so much of it comes down to Roe v. Wade -- at least, that's how the left is presenting it," Christopher Scalia said, referring to the landmark 1973 case holding that women have a constitutional right to an abortion within certain trimesters.</seg>
<seg id="4">In one fell swoop, Roe effectively prevented states from deciding on their own how to regulate abortion, and several states immediately took steps to try to restrict abortion rights in response.</seg>
<seg id="5">"My father often said, with Roe v. Wade in particular but other cases as well, the court was really trying to come in and settle a cultural issue that should have been resolved in elections, and the legislative process," he added during his appearance on "Fox & Friends."</seg>
<seg id="6">"By trying to short-circuit that process, the Supreme Court caused more damage and, as a result, Supreme Court nominations and confirmation battles have become more heated, because justices have taken on the role that properly belongs to legislators."</seg>
<seg id="7">Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse made a similar point during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings earlier this month, when he reiterated that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies and improperly leaves the resulting bureaucratic uncertainties to the Supreme Court to resolve -- effectively making the justices supplemental legislators doing a job abdicated by senators.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of protesters were arrested and charged by Capitol Hill police for improperly interfering with those confirmation proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="9">Asked whether Kavanaugh had any chance of avoiding that kind of backlash -- which now centers primarily on uncorroborated allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct decades ago -- Scalia said there was likely no avoiding the uproar.</seg>
<seg id="10">Responding to claims that Kavanaugh shouldn't serve on the Supreme Court because of his fiery and, at times, defiant behavior during questioning about the lurid allegations against him by senators on Thursday, Scalia suggested justices don't always have calm temperaments.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's really not all that rare for justices to get angry," Scalia said, referencing sometimes-heated dissents in hot-button cases.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's true that judge Kavanaugh was perhaps more aggressive, but that's because the circumstances were a lot different.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was defending his good name from uncorroborated accusations."</seg>
<seg id="14">Kavanaugh on Thursday received the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by a party-line 11-10 vote, to advance to a full Senate floor vote.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a dramatic moment, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he would provide his crucial swing vote in favor of Kavanaugh only if the FBI were given a one-week period in which to investigate current and credible misconduct claims against Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="16">That investigation is ongoing, and President Trump has said the agency has broad authority in the probe to interview "whoever" it wants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cheaper electric cars will run on roads by 2025, saving us from the troubles of Petrol-Diesel.</seg>
<seg id="2">Strike against it. Now we will get rid of these things soon.</seg>
<seg id="3">The price of petrol diesel is sky rocketing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Considering this, the government and the companies have started preparing the electric and hybrid cars in India. Many big companies are going to launch electric cars by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within seven years 349 models might be available on the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is good news for those who want to buy a car in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="7">They can now directly buy electric cars instead of diesel petrol cars.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the year 2023, in those 349 launched models of electric cars, 50% will be SUV cars.</seg>
<seg id="9">So Indian customers will get all types of cars at every price point.</seg>
<seg id="10">This fact came to light by the report of ICCT, an international research organisation conducted during the Global Mobility Summit on Electronic Trade in India.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the report, in 2017 there were 155 models of electric cars in the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">But with increased basic facilities of car charging, higher quality batteries and fast chargers are also coming up.</seg>
<seg id="13">So the demand for this car is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">All the car companies in the world are preparing new models of electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="15">The increased production has reduced prices too.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hopefully by 2025 the cost of electric cars will be less than petrol cars.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, electric car sales in the big cities are on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="18">Los Angeles has one of the largest number of electric cars in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the National Electricity Mobility Plan 2013, by 2020, the number of electric vehicles was targeted to reach 60-70 lakhs.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Shanghai, Beijing, Oslo and San Francisco, the number has increased more than 50-50 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, in 2018, the central government said that by the year 2030, there would be 30% electric cars in the new merchandise car.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than 1.5 crores of e-cars will be there. By 2020 we will have 30 lakh electric cars, up 40 lakhs in the beginning of 2017, in which, more than 50% of the electric cars in China are still running in 20 months in Europe and 17% in the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fantastical frocks rule in off-the-peg Schiaparelli range</seg>
<seg id="2">Can you make surrealism real?</seg>
<seg id="3">That is the question for the house of Schiaparelli.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Paris couture house founded by Elsa Schiaparelli almost a century ago has launched its first collection of ready-to-wear clothes and handbags.</seg>
<seg id="5">For a label that has always celebrated the fantastical rather than the wearable, it is a concept almost as far fetched as Elsa Schiaparelli's famous hat in the shape of an upturned shoe.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet despite its long history of eccentricity, there is something very modern about this fashion house.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aesthetic is emoji-like, all lobsters, hearts and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Schiaparelli designed the first jumpsuit, in 1930, and was the first designer to set a catwalk show to music.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was Schiaparelli and her friend Salvador Dalí who invented the art-fashion collaboration, as currently espoused at Calvin Klein and Raf Simons with US artist Sterling Ruby.</seg>
<seg id="10">Legend has it that Dali wanted the lobster-embroidered evening gown he and Schiaparelli created to be displayed in the salon with a dressing of real mayonnaise, but he was overruled.</seg>
<seg id="11">Black strapless dress with Man Ray Electricité design across the bustier.</seg>
<seg id="12">Photograph: Schiaparelli</seg>
<seg id="13">"We wanted to revisit this idea of collaboration, which is such a part of Schiaparelli history" said Bertrand Guyon, creative director for the past three years, speaking at the house's salon in Place Vendôme.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the ready-to-wear collection, he took as a starting point Schiaparelli's friendship with Man Ray and created clothes based on iconic artworks, in partnership with the Man Ray Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Glass Tears, the artist's famous close up of a pair of eyes, appears on a white T-shirt studded with Perspex teardrops, while the floating red lips from Observatory Time: The Lovers appear on a collaged, silk-screen shift dress.</seg>
<seg id="16">Man Ray's Glass Tears appears on a T-shirt from the collection.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of Elsa's quirks was a superstitious devotion to the letter S. Shocking pink, her signature colour, inspired her perfume, Shocking.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Schiaparelli handbag, designed by Guyon with a keyhole design on the clasp, is called Secret.</seg>
<seg id="19">It will retail at the fantastical price of £5,000.</seg>
<seg id="20">The surreal side of Paris fashion week was also on display yesterday at a pop-up shop in a warehouse on the left bank of the Seine, selling €100 rugs from Virgil Abloh's soon-to-be released collection for Ikea.</seg>
<seg id="21">Half an hour before the opening time, a 500-strong queue of Abloh's young fans stretched along the quai, excited by the prospect of buying one of his designs without the price tags that come with his Louis Vuitton menswear.</seg>
<seg id="22">For Abloh, the project keeps communication channels open with a broader audience than can afford luxury fashion or designer furniture.</seg>
<seg id="23">"No one owns anything any more, but if you have knowledge of a certain chair, then it is part of your dinner conversation.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is the millennials" train of thought," he said recently.</seg>
<seg id="25">By the time models began zooming past the audience on skateboards in a garage in the Marais, it was clear that this was not a day for ordinary catwalk shows.</seg>
<seg id="26">Andreas Kronthaler, Vivienne Westwood's husband and a designer in his own right, took Jessica Fulford-Dobson's portraits of female skateboarders in Kabul as a starting point for a collection that saw men and women in colourful loose robes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some women - and a few men - skated in heeled mule sandals, although those in vertiginous platform boots stayed on foot.</seg>
<seg id="28">Westwood, who watched from the front row in a horse-print dress from the collection and an orange cardigan tied around her waist, joined her husband on the catwalk for his final bow, where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers.</seg>

<seg id="6">The project is primarily a visual one, he says: "It's not a documentary or scientific project - my main goal was to make powerful, emotive portraits of people."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nurses pass vote of no confidence in union over pay deal handling</seg>
<seg id="2">Royal College of Nursing members angry with their union's handling of changes to the NHS pay deal have voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the organisation in a unprecedented move amid accusations it had misrepresented expected pay increases.</seg>
<seg id="3">It came after a protracted saga within the RCN after its former general secretary Janet Davies admitted it had wrongly told members they would all be in line for an immediate 3% pay increase this year following the end of the 1% pay cap.</seg>
<seg id="4">Members were frustrated after many did not receive expected rises in pay, forcing Davies to step down amid pressure from members, which led to the no-confidence vote in the college's council at an emergency general meeting in Birmingham on Friday following a petition.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has cleared the air and the college will emerge stronger as a result," the RCN chair, Maria Trewern, said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This vote is clear and the council and management of the RCN have received the message.</seg>
<seg id="7">Council has already driven change within the organisation in recent weeks - to listen more closely to members and involve them thoroughly - and this will continue."</seg>
<seg id="8">A meeting will take place next week and it is expected that members of the RCN council will step down.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nursing is based on trust," an NHS nurse told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The actions of the RCN council have destroyed the trust that we had in them and they must go.</seg>
<seg id="11">I hope they will do the honourable thing and comply with request.</seg>
<seg id="12">I await with interest to see if the members of other unions seek the same redress."</seg>
<seg id="13">Rachel Harrison, the GMB national officer for the NHS, told the Guardian in August: "Up and down the country, NHS staff have opened their pay cheques and realised it's not the pay rise they thought they were going to get.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they are angry."</seg>
<seg id="15">Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the RCN conceded that it made a number of mistakes in its processes around the 2018 pay deal and its communication.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it stated that the RCN's "Scrap the Cap" campaign forced the government to end the pay cap with a phased pay rise worth 6.5% now set to be introduced over three years.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vote came after an independent report found that the RCN's presentation of the deal was biased towards its acceptance, while Davies was accused of "closing down" scrutiny of the deal.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is claimed that the RCN presented "factually incorrect" information, meaning that members were not able to make an informed judgment on the deal, while alternative options were not explored.</seg>
<seg id="19">The RCN published contradictory information on whether the 3% rise would apply for all members.</seg>
<seg id="20">In a separate briefing before the RCN's congress, representatives were incorrectly told there would be a "3% increase, plus an increase from incremental reform."</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the 3% increase included the incremental rises and, in any case, only certain workers at the top of their pay band would receive that rise immediately.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The majority of information conveyed to members about the implementation of the deal after congress was inaccurate (probably a result of an attempt to simplify the message)," a spokesperson from the Electoral Reform Services, who conducted the report, said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"ERS believes that failure to inform decision makers of information that compared the current system with the proposed deal in a clear succinct manner, hindered informed balanced judgment as it failed to provide clear context to the headline gains, including the 6.5% and 29% figures used in during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="24">The motion of no confidence passed with 78% in favour on a turnout of 3.74% of RCN members.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lindsay Lohan is facing criticism after posting a live video on Instagram in which she follows a homeless family down the street, trying to separate the sons from their parents.</seg>
<seg id="3">Possibly shot in Moscow (based on previous Instagram Story updates from Lohan) the Live video starts with the actor offering to put a roof over the family's head for the night, but the situation soon becomes fraught.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Hey everyone, I just want to show you a family that I met," she tells viewers, "a Syrian refugee family that I'm really worried about.</seg>
<seg id="5">They really need help.</seg>
<seg id="6">You want to come with me?</seg>
<seg id="7">Come with me, I'll take care of you guys," she says to the family, before turning to one of the children: "Do you want to stay in a hotel tonight?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you want to watch movies?</seg>
<seg id="9">It would be so cool to watch a movie on a TV or a computer."</seg>
<seg id="10">When the parents refuse, Lohan becomes confrontational.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You should not have them your sons on the floor, you should be a hard-working woman and you should be doing what you can for your children, so they have a better life," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If someone is offering them a home and a bed, which is me at the moment, give it to them.</seg>
<seg id="13">They will come back to you.</seg>
<seg id="14">I won't leave until I take you.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now I know who you are.</seg>
<seg id="16">Don't f*** with me."</seg>
<seg id="17">When the family attempt to evade Lohan by walking off down the street, she follows them, still broadcasting on Instagram Live.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Look what's happening, they're trafficking children. You're ruining Arabic culture by doing this."</seg>
<seg id="19">"You're taking these children, they want to go.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm with you boys, don't worry, the whole world is seeing this right now."</seg>

<seg id="1">Third of Britons believe they will never clear their debts</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost a third of British people believe they will never clear their debts in their lifetimes and more than one in 10 say they won't even be able to reduce their debt levels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Research by Equifax and Gorkana, seen exclusively by The Independent, reveals that people aged between 18 and 24, in particular, believe they face a lifetime of debt, with just half saying they expect to ever be able get back into the black.</seg>
<seg id="4">Students graduate with an average debt of £46,000, according to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report out last year, and students from the poorest backgrounds graduate with debts of more than £57,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, the vast majority of graduates - 81 per cent - will never clear their debt in full, which means they'll spend the first 30 years of their working lives with a debt hanging over them.</seg>
<seg id="6">Debt levels across society are rising; figures from the Office for National Statistics show that household debt in the UK is at a record high, with Britons spending an average of £900 more than they earn each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">But just how worried should we be about this flurry of depression-inducing stats?</seg>
<seg id="8">Is a lifelong relationship with debt simply the new normal - not just for younger adults, but for the entire population?</seg>
<seg id="9">Take cars, for example - often the biggest purchase we'll make after buying (if we're lucky) a home.</seg>
<seg id="10">This week, Auto Trader predicted that within a decade all new cars will be bought on finance as the way we expect to pay for our motoring changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jeannie Boyle, director and chartered financial planner at EQ Investors, certainly believes there has been a shift in expectation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Debt is definitely more normal now - credit cards are more prevalent, and so are zero per cent balance transfers, student loans and pay day lenders," she says.</seg>
<seg id="13">"For our grandparents' generation it was shameful to be in debt."</seg>
<seg id="14">In recent times, student debt and house prices have normalised debt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, agrees and says the result could be worrying.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If you're having to borrow four to five times your income to buy a property, an enormous sum in itself, adding some more debt to that may not seem like such a big deal," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">And that is where people are going to get into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="18">Interest rates have been very low for many years and people with big mortgages or other debts should be aware that they need to factor in a cushion for when rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps understandably, commentators from the finance industry seem confident.</seg>
<seg id="20">Brian Brodie, chief executive of the loans agency Freedom Finance, says: "Debt isn't a dirty word."</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether financing home improvements or purchasing a new car, taking out a loan is no longer seen as the "last resort."</seg>
<seg id="22">Low interest rates have driven many people to lock their savings away in fixed-term accounts that offer higher returns, but reduced access to savings.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a result, "middle class" borrowing is on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the last six months, around half of our new loans were taken out by customers with an "excellent" credit rating.</seg>
<seg id="25">For Richard Haymes, head of financial difficulties at Equifax company TDX Group, this expectation of a lifetime of debt is a clear concern.</seg>
<seg id="26">He says: "With inflation hitting a six-month high in August (2.7 per cent), a recent interest rate rise and limited wage growth, it's disconcerting that a large proportion of people are taking on debt without a realistic expectation of being able to pay it back."</seg>
<seg id="27">According to our analysis, personal insolvencies are set to grow by 17 per cent this year, and the main contributing factor is record levels of consumer borrowing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Debt might be manageable while people work and earn but there's concern about what a lifetime in debt might mean for our old-age wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Research carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with equity release specialist More 2 Life shows that unsecured debt among 55- to 74-year-olds has risen by more than a third over the last four years, more than twice as fast as the national average.</seg>
<seg id="30">And the most common form of debt for this age group is credit cards, with 30 per cent spending more than they pay off each month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Boyle adds: "We're increasingly seeing people using pension freedoms to pay off debt when they turn 55, which has an impact on their wellbeing in retirement.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is often the only savings they've effectively been "forced" to make.</seg>
<seg id="33">People also think they will use equity in their property to pay it off later - but this is problematic as downsizing does not always release as much money as expected.</seg>
<seg id="34">Any future drop in property process will exacerbate this.</seg>

<seg id="2">Serena Williams has released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" while covering her bare chest with her hands.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tennis pro shared the clip on her Instagram page, explaining that she created the video to encourage women to self-check their breasts.</seg>
<seg id="4">"This Breast Cancer Awareness Month I've recorded a version of The Divinyls global hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to self-check regularly," Williams wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it's an issue that affects all women of all colours, all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Early detection is key - it saves so many lives.</seg>
<seg id="7">I just hope this helps to remind women of that."</seg>
<seg id="8">Williams continued: "The music video is part of the "I Touch Myself Project" which was created in honour of celebrated diva, Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer, and who gave us her hit song to remind women to put their health first."</seg>
<seg id="9">The project, which is supported by lingerie brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), first launched in 2014 following the passing of Amphlett at the age of 53.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since posting the video on her Instagram account, it has been viewed more than 1.5 million times with legions of fans praising the tennis superstar for performing the song.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So much love for this and what you did, putting yourself out there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thank you Serena," one person wrote.</seg>
<seg id="13">Another added: "I LOVE this, Serena.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm a breast cancer survivor of 20 years and I found the lump myself on self-exam even after mammograms showed nothing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Exams are so so important.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thank you for putting yourself out of your comfort zone - you are a goddess!"</seg>
<seg id="17">As part of the "I Touch Myself Project," Berlei is also releasing a new snakeskin print, rock star inspired bra called The Chrissy.</seg>
<seg id="18">100 per cent of the profits from the bra will be donated to BCNA.</seg>
<seg id="19">When self-checking, it is important to know the signs and symptoms you should be looking for.</seg>
<seg id="20">As well as lumps, other signs of breast cancer include a change in breast size or shape, a rash or skin sores, nipple discharge, skin indentation, constant pain or a change in skin texture.</seg>
<seg id="21">Similarly, swelling around the armpit or collarbone could be an indicator, as can a growing vein or inverted nipple.</seg>
<seg id="22">Women are advised to check their breasts each month.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you notice any symptoms of breast cancer, the NHS advises that you see your GP as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">After examination, your GP will then refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic if they feel your symptoms need further assessment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Adam Driver was the guest host of Saturday Night Live this week, and he really gave 110%.</seg>
<seg id="3">The show's funniest sketches always tend to be the ones that aren't pegged to a specific current event, and so was the case with new skit "Career Day."</seg>
<seg id="4">It centres on a "bring your father to work" day at an American high school, where teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees to let his elderly oil baron father, Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), give a talk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hobbling in on a cane, Parnassus proceeds to deliver a blistering account of his domination of the oil industry, a megalomaniac likely inspired in part by the Daniel Day-Lewis "There Will Be Blood" character Daniel Plainview.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I was born seven months too early," Parnassus tells the students.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Incubation technology was still in its infancy, so they placed me in a cast iron pot inside a pizza oven until I was ripe enough to walk.</seg>
<seg id="8">My bones never hardened but my spirit did.</seg>
<seg id="9">Be strong and crush your enemies!"</seg>
<seg id="10">Davidson, along with fellow SNL cast member Aidy Bryant who plays the schoolteacher, struggle to keep straight faces and are largely unable to look Driver in the eye.</seg>

<seg id="1">'I'm A Victim of Sexual Assault'</seg>
<seg id="2">Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said Sunday morning that she is a victim of sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="3">Conway responded to the intense exchanges during the past week's testimonies from Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response, Conway emotionally declared she herself is a victim of sexual assault in the past and defended Kavanaugh to host Jake Tapper, saying she believes sexual assault accusations against him were "cherry-picked."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.</seg>
<seg id="6">I'm a victim of sexual assault," Conway told CNN's "State of the Union" program Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'm a victim of sexual assault, I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh or Take Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to be held responsible for that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kavanaugh And Ford Testimonies Have Divided America, Poll Shows</seg>
<seg id="2">Americas are at odds over the testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who claims the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the number of people who believed Ford or Kavanaugh were lying was similar, with 38 percent saying they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while a smaller 30 percent said the same about Ford.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both parties after Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein detailing her allegation against the judge.</seg>
<seg id="5">When the letter was made publi,c both Ford and Kavanaugh said they would be prepared to speak before the committee.</seg>
<seg id="6">During her testimony, Ford said she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was the person who had attempted to assault her at a house party in the early 1980s dismissing the idea that there could be a case of mistaken identity.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an emotional opening statement the 51-year-old said she had felt it was her civic duty to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am terrified," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kavanaugh, who denied the allegations made by Ford, as well as by two other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, said he had "never sexually assaulted anyone - not in high school, not in college, not ever."</seg>
<seg id="11">"There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything - no matter how far-fetched or odious, that will block a vote of my nomination," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"These are last minute smears, pure and simple."</seg>
<seg id="13">Unsurprisingly, the results of the YouGov poll, which surveyed 2,607 people from 27-28 September were split on party lines, with Democrats far more likely to believe Ford (73 percent) and Republicans more likely to believe Kavanaugh (74 percent,) although more Republicans believed Ford than Democrats did Kavanaugh (14 percent compared with 11 percent.)</seg>

<seg id="2">The German scientist who invented plastination wants to be a permanent part of his Body Worlds exhibition after he dies.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gunther von Hagens came up with the pioneering technique, which allowed the display of cadavers, skulls and organs in exhibitions that have gone around the world and sparked amazement as well as controversy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now terminally ill with cancer, the 73-year-old has instructed his wife to plastinate him after his death so that he become a permanent fixture in the Body Worlds exhibition which opens to the public this week in London.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's somehow finalising his life's work.</seg>
<seg id="6">I understand now that it's more an appreciation and an expression of love for me to do it," Angelina Whalley told The Observer.</seg>
<seg id="7">She said that her husband has issued strict instructions on what to do with his corpse in a process that takes about a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Muscles, nerves and arteries need to be unwound, the body will be injected with silicone and then put in a pose.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He said to me: "Angelina, you are entitled to freeze me down to -25 Celsius for one year, but after that time you really need to put your hands on me because otherwise I will get freeze burn.""</seg>
<seg id="10">So I have one year for mourning and then I will have to do it."</seg>
<seg id="11">Then, ideally wearing his trademark fedora hat, he will join the exhibition in the London Pavilion, with other bodies frozen in time and erected in poses like riding a horse or playing cards.</seg>
<seg id="12">Von Hagens rose to fame in the UK when he performed a live autopsy on British television, the first public autopsy for 170 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">More than 47 million people have visited versions of Body Worlds around the world since 1995.</seg>
<seg id="14">Founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernal, told The Guardian that the 28,000 square foot exhibition space was based on 100% donations from people who "have given consent in order to help and educate the living, to help people see what can go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">We see and read so many horrible things that it makes us scared of death.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are all going there, that's what we have in common, we are all going to die and I think Body Worlds shows us that you don't have to be afraid," Tabernal said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lawyers for the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said Friday that they would sue a German magazine after it had published what they called "blatantly illegal" accusations by an American woman who says she was raped by Ronaldo in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of Ronaldo's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the report in the magazine, Der Spiegel, was "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy" and that he would seek legal redress for his client from the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="4">The statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo's agent, the firm Gestifute, in response to a request for comment on Der Spiegel's article, which was published online Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gestifute did not answer any specific questions about the content of Der Spiegel's report, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.</seg>
<seg id="6">Der Spiegel first reported on the allegation in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ronaldo, one of the biggest names in world sports, is a five-time world player of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">He transferred to Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid this summer; the Italian club declined to comment on Der Spiegel's report.</seg>
<seg id="9">The magazine said the suspected rape took place in June 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas, according to Leslie Mark Stovall, the lawyer for the woman who made the accusation, Kathryn Mayorga.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ronaldo and Mayorga then reached an out-of-court settlement, according to Stovall and the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, Mayorga agreed to a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a $375,000 payment from Ronaldo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Stovall did not immediately respond to email requests from Reuters for comment on the article, and Mayorga did not answer telephone calls to her home.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stovall told Der Spiegel, however, that he had filed a civil complaint seeking to declare the nondisclosure agreement void.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayorga told Der Spiegel she no longer felt bound by the agreement as she suffers from the consequences of the night nine years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I've had like these serious breakdowns," she told Der Spiegel.</seg>
<seg id="16">"And again, blaming of the rape.</seg>
<seg id="17">And I blame him, and I blame myself for signing that thing."</seg>

<seg id="1">Independence Through Sustainable Author Businesses</seg>
<seg id="2">Are you ready for self-publishing 3.0?</seg>
<seg id="3">In a new white paper released today on #selfpub3.0, the Alliance of Independent Authors details how, for the first time, authors can now join the ranks of other creative entrepreneurs in growing their independence and building sustainable author businesses.</seg>
<seg id="4">Orna Ross, founder of the Alliance of Independent Authors and repeatedly named "One of the 100 Most Influential People in Publishing," will explain why and how authors should embrace self-publishing 3.0 at Digital Book World 2018.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Consumer trends like the rise of personal branding, mindful consumption and mobile phone reading are combining with digital publishing tech to create more favorable conditions than ever before for author-businesses," says Ross.</seg>
<seg id="6">But only authors who have developed an independent, creative and empowered mindset, who understand the value of their intellectual property, can benefit from these opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="7">#selfpub3.0 encourages authors to ensure we have a diversity of earning streams through our own websites, which become the hub of our successful publishing and media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="8">Income streams might include direct sales, subscription models, crowdsourced patronage, wide distribution models and other income streams like online teaching and affiliate income.</seg>
<seg id="9">#selfpub3.0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books as widely as possible, in as many formats as possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mostly, #selfpub3.0 is about the shift in mindset needed to take control of your author business rather than unthinkingly assigning all your intellectual property, your most valuable creative asset, to a business owned by another, whether that is a trade-publisher or self-publishing service.</seg>
<seg id="11">These are the steps that maximize income, impact, and influence for authors and should be of interest to every author and publisher working in the digital age, Ross says, pointing out that true independence, for authors as for anyone, must be rooted in commercial as well as creative independence.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the future, now.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it has never been so bright for independent authors.</seg>
<seg id="14">Self-Publishing 1.0 was desktop publishing and print on demand.</seg>
<seg id="15">Self-Publishing 2.0 was selling e-books for e-readers and phones via online bookstores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now we're entering the era of self-publishing 3.0: self-publishers building viable and sustainable author enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Alliance of Independent Authors is the only global, non-profit association for self-publishing writers.</seg>
<seg id="18">ALLi aims to foster excellence and ethics in self-publishing; to support authors in the making and selling of their books; and to advocate for author independence through the building of sustainable digital businesses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Italy president, central banker warn government over deficit plan</seg>
<seg id="2">Italy's president and its central bank governor on Saturday warned that the country's debt must remain sustainable after the populist government unveiled plans to significantly raise deficit spending next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Late on Thursday, the ruling parties - made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - proposed a 2019 deficit that is, at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), three times the previous administration's target.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement rattled markets on Friday, prompting a sell-off of bonds and a rout of banking stocks.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also set up a clash with the European Commission, which monitors and enforces EU fiscal rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">President Sergio Mattarella, addressing a group at the presidential palace that had marked the 70th anniversary of the constitution, noted that the state's founding law requires "balanced budgets and the sustainability of debt."</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is to protect the savings of our fellow citizens," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">A little later at a conference in central Italy, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said the country's debt, the largest among big European Union economies at 131 percent of GDP, must not be allowed to increase.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Italy needs to favor public and private investment and to contain and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to Ansa state news agency.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The debt must be "put on downward path," he added.</seg>
<seg id="11">Matteo Salvini, leader of the League and also a deputy prime minister, responded to Mattarella by saying that years of Brussels-imposed austerity had driven up debt.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Be calm Mr. President," Salvini said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Years of budgets imposed by Europe have made our public debt explode. Finally we are changing course and betting on the future and on growth."</seg>
<seg id="14">Earlier, before either Mattarella or Visco spoke, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the budget would "repay the people for the thieving of the past," though he added the government's intention was not to challenge the EU or financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ruling parties pushed Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is an economist unaffiliated with either group, to sign off on their plans to hike deficit spending.</seg>
<seg id="16">Italian media said Mattarella had supported Tria's failed effort to keep the deficit target below 2 percent of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The president and the central banker have no direct role in making economic policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 77-year-old president can reject a law and send it back to parliament, but he can do so only once.</seg>
<seg id="19">Parliament can then pass it again, unchanged, and he must sign it into law.</seg>

<seg id="1">Indonesia tsunami sensors missed huge waves: official</seg>
<seg id="2">Indonesia's geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning 34 minutes after it was first issued following a major earthquake that sent huge waves crashing into the northeastern coast of Sulawesi island, killing hundreds and leaving thousands more homeless.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ruins of cars as seen after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami, which hit the city of Palu about 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta and further along the coastline, killed at least 384 people.</seg>
<seg id="5">Officials said on Saturday the death toll was likely to rise.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their death.</seg>
<seg id="7">The geophysics agency (BMKG) faced criticism on Saturday on social media, with many questioning if the tsunami warning was lifted too soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to "end" the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have no observation data at Palu.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that," said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami center at BMKG.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in sea level, only recorded an "insignificant," six-centimeter (2.5 inches) wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is something we must evaluate for the future," said Triyono.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was not clear whether the tsunami, which officials say hammered Palu and the surrounding area at extremely high speeds measuring in the hundreds of kilometers per hour, occurred before or after the warning had been lifted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Resident checks dead bodies to find their family at a street after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Based on the videos circulating on social media, we estimate the tsunami happened before the warning officially ended," Triyono said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The most devastating came on Boxing Day in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including over 126,000 in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="18">The scenic town of Palu sits at the mouth of a narrow bay in northeastern Sulawesi and is home to around 380,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was hit by a tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB).</seg>
<seg id="20">Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at University of Oxford, said it was "surprising" the quake had generated a tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="21">Friday's quake was recorded as a "strike-slip" event where neighboring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami," he said, adding the narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster agency, told reporters his team had been "preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand" when the tsunami warning was "suddenly ended."</seg>
<seg id="24">The communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Nugroho said the quake had brought down the area's power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast.</seg>
<seg id="25">Indonesians took to social media to question the BMKG's move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="26">"So upset.. the warning was lifted.. although a tsunami happened..." said one Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golf: 'Mollywood' duo on course to smash box office records</seg>
<seg id="2">Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood won their foursomes on Saturday to become the first European duo to sweep all four pairs matches and are on course for even more history as Europe take a 10-6 lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup.</seg>
<seg id="3">After thumping Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau 5&4 they became the first-ever European pairing to win all four of their matches.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins, in 1979, have ever managed it for the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crushing winning margins - 3&1, 5&4, 4&3 and 5&4 - tell only half the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">Left in their dust was a battered Woods, the 14-times major winner being drubbed three times, with Patrick Reed brushed aside twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">The other win came against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the form pairing of the U.S. team this week who won their other three games.</seg>
<seg id="8">Molinari and Fleetwood go into Sunday's singles with the chance to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fleetwood has already claimed the most points in a single Ryder Cup by a European rookie.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dubbed "Mollywood" by their newly-acquired army of fans, at first glance the pair might have looked unlikely contenders to lead the European charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ryder Cup first-timers such as Fleetwood are not supposed to perform like this, while Molinari had failed to win any of his six previous matches, losing four of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, a more positive view was that Fleetwood was European number one last year, knows the Le Golf National course inside out having won the French Open here in 2017, and showed his big-match temperament by finishing second in this year's U.S. Open.</seg>
<seg id="13">Molinari is the freshly-minted British Open champion and widely regarded as the most consistent ball-striker on the European Tour - an attribute that has paid huge dividends on the tight course where finding the rough, as the Americans all-too-often did, was a recipe for disaster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those pedigrees, combined with what looked like a great on-course chemistry, proved an irresistible force.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I feel a little bit emotional now and we're only on Saturday," said the famously laid-back Fleetwood, who has played all weekend with a huge smile on his face.</seg>
<seg id="16">We were really good this afternoon, really solid and played really well.</seg>
<seg id="17">To have your own piece of history together is really special.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm just glad we've done our job for the team."</seg>
<seg id="19">Molinari was equally delighted.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Playing alongside Tommy, it's been amazing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But we've come to do a job, not to go in the record books, those 4-1/2 points we'll need tomorrow for the overall victory we will have to fight hard for; it's not going to be easy."</seg>

<seg id="2">FBI agents investigating U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have contacted the second woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct, her attorney said on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer John Clune indicates that the FBI probe of Kavanaugh will look beyond separate allegations of attempted rape leveled against the conservative federal appeals court judge by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University dormitory when they were undergraduates.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.S. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI investigation after Thursday's Senate hearing, during which Ford, a California university professor, detailed her claims that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when the two were still high school teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had constrained the FBI investigation by limiting its parameters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trump denied that story, tweeting that "Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion."</seg>

<seg id="3">Mickelson conceded the hole after firing his tee shot into the water with Molinari on the green to leave the Italian as the first European to win all five matches in a week - having not won any of his previous six.</seg>
<seg id="4">Europe were effectively already assured of victory when he teed off as the Italian, Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were all dormie and guaranteed at least half a point from their games - with Europe at that stage needing one.</seg>

<seg id="2">A pair of police officers in eastern Germany used the name of a notorious neo-Nazi extremist to work undercover during an operation to protect Turkish President Erdogan who visited Berlin this week, local media reveal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Criminal police in the eastern German state of Saxony are inquiring into two members of elite counter-terrorism unit SEK, the regional interior ministry said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The men were deployed to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his much-anticipated trip to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the officers had to work undercover, protocol required that they use a codename.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their choice was Uwe Boehnhardt, a notorious member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) - a neo-Nazi extremist group that slaughtered eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek citizen, and a German police officer in the 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="7">The bizarre codename surfaced when the two signed up to access internal documents they needed for the deployment, local media report.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers in charge of the operation reacted swiftly, and the policemen were immediately recalled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Petric Kleine, the head of Saxony criminal police, was first to react to the news.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said the use of Boehnhardt's name was "hardly to be beaten in stupidity" and represented "blatant disregard of [his] victims and their relatives."</seg>
<seg id="11">Roland Woller, Saxony's interior minister, echoed the words, calling it "disgusting, horrible and absolutely unacceptable."</seg>
<seg id="12">Erdogan's Friday visit to Berlin has stirred considerable controversy in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for hosting a leader which some accuse of being increasingly authoritarian.</seg>
<seg id="14">Merkel said the visit was very important "because when there are differences a personal meeting is vital to resolve them."</seg>
<seg id="15">The NSU first came to light in 2011 when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were found inside a burnt-out motorhome in eastern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">The two are believed to have died in an apparent murder-suicide after a failed bank robbery in a town of Eisenach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beate Zschaepe, the neo-Nazi gang's third and last surviving member, was detained shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="18">In July of this year, a German court sentenced her to life in prison, finding her guilty on 10 counts of murder.</seg>
<seg id="19">She denied participating in the murders, although her lawyer said that she felt morally guilty for not trying to prevent the killings.</seg>
<seg id="20">The scandal surrounding the NSU has led to widespread criticism of German security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lawyers, activists, and relatives of the victims believe that the group had far more accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="22">It also came out that the BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, had placed numerous informants within the NSU and systematically thwarted and made impossible the investigation of murders, attempted murders, and robberies attributed to the group.</seg>

<seg id="2">Elon Musk has settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which had sued him for fraud over his tweets about taking Tesla private.</seg>
<seg id="3">Musk will have to step down as chairman, but gets to keep his CEO status.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the settlement filing, Musk has 45 days to step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, and is banned from holding the position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="5">He will also have to pay a $20 million fine.</seg>
<seg id="6">And since the whole affair started over a tweet, either careless or intentionally misleading, Musk is required to receive pre-approval for anything he says or posts about Tesla, "in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g., Twitter), the Company's website (e.g., the Company's blog), press releases, and investor calls."</seg>
<seg id="7">Another $20mn will be paid by Tesla to settle claims it had failed to vet Musk's initial tweet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The SEC complaint accused Musk of misleading investors with his August 7 tweet which said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, boosting the company's stock by more than 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Musk soon recanted, saying he would keep Tesla private and triggering investors' fury.</seg>
<seg id="10">The SEC ruled Musk's initial words "were false and misleading because they lacked any basis in fact."</seg>
<seg id="11">Musk himself claimed it was an honest mistake, writing in a blog post that he was under the impression that he had secured the money in a meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.</seg>
<seg id="12">Musk and the SEC had reportedly been close to a less punishing settlement, which would only have barred Musk from being chairman for two years and would not have required him to admit any guilt, but Musk backed out on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then on Friday, Tesla stock tanked, apparently causing him to change his mind again and accept the harsher conditions.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, like the old deal, the new one does not require Musk to admit to being guilty of misleading investors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has shown support for the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is part of the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="3">It comes amid a rift between the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Theodore II arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on Thursday, meeting high church representatives and the Orthodox faithful.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected hierarchs of the Orthodoxy, second only to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have come here to tell you: Stay with the Orthodox faith and with the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ahead of the visit to Odessa, he met with the head of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Savva, who backed the canonical Ukrainian church as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">The two also called for conflicts stemming from giving autocephality to the Ukrainian church to be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We will always be with those who seeks the Orthodox unity," Theodore II pledged.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Orthodox Church has faced a major crisis recently, following the Constantinople Patriarchy's move towards recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latter is a constituent part of the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Constantinople has decided to send its exarchs to Kiev, effectively violating the rule in which one Orthodox Church is forbidden to interfere in the internal affairs of another.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exarchs are special representatives of a patriarch, who technically have a higher position in the church hierarchy than Metropolitan Onufriy, the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to Constantinople's move, suspending the joint performance of church services and membership in all the structures led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.</seg>
<seg id="15">The decision, however, was said to be a "warning" to Constantinople against further hostile steps and does not constitute a complete break of inter-church ties.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ukraine hosts three Orthodox Churches, yet only one of them - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate - is recognized by other Churches.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most Ukrainian clerics recognize its authority, but the government has been openly courting one of the schismatic churches - the so-called Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="18">The religious movement even has its own self-proclaimed "Patriarch" Filaret, who seeks to gain the official status of an Orthodox Church, fully independent and "equal" to the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Major takeaways from Lavrov's UN speech</seg>
<seg id="2">At the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lashed out at the West's "political blackmail and brute force," saying diplomacy should not give way to diktats and unilateral sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trying to preserve their "self-proclaimed status as world leaders," some Western powers have no qualms about putting pressure on others, Foreign Minister Lavrov told the UN General Assembly on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He didn't name the countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force."</seg>
<seg id="5">The world has to pay a high price for these selfish ambitions by a tiny group of countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lavrov, who was once Russia's envoy to the UN for a decade, told the gathering that the culture of diplomacy and negotiating is being replaced by diktats and one-sided sanctions put in place without UN approval.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such restrictions that extend to dozens of countries "are either unlawful or inefficient," the minister noted, citing the US" decades-long blockade of Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="8">"But history didn't teach us anything," Lavrov said, adding that allegations "based on the notorious "highly likely" thing are sufficient for some Western counterparts to pin the blame on anyone."</seg>
<seg id="9">We do remember how often these unfounded claims were used to justify interventions and ignite wars, such the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, 2003 invasion of Iraq and 2011 intervention in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The list of Western-led invasions was obviously not exhaustive, as Lavrov referred to the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest instances.</seg>
<seg id="11">A failed attempt to topple the regime in Damascus - which was conducted by engaging extremists - could have seen the whole country collapse and give way to a "terrorist caliphate."</seg>
<seg id="12">Lavrov praised the Astana Peace Process, launched jointly by Russia, Turkey, and Iran, which he said helped prevent Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and other groups from claiming all of Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">Top priority now is to rebuild war-ridden places in the country and help refugees safely return to their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jumping back to the great powers competition, Lavrov stated that the UN was in fact created "on the lessons learnt from the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Russian foreign minister noted that 2018 marks 80 years since the "disgraceful" 1938 Munich Agreement, in which France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazi annexation of the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia in a bid to appease Hitler.</seg>
<seg id="16">Though Neville Chamberlain, then British prime minister, claimed the Munich Agreement meant "peace for our time," the war started one year later.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Munich betrayal" shows us how far "national egoism and neglect of international law" can go, Lavrov said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Colonial-era diktat and coercion should be sent into the archive or the dustbin of history."</seg>
<seg id="19">Moscow believes constructive dialogue can meet any challenges that arise in world affairs, according to Lavrov.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If you have any questions or claims to anyone, then sit down and talk, show facts, listen to your counterpart's arguments, try to balance your interests."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Scottish Government has said there were no recorded complaints regarding Alex Salmond before January this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two allegations of sexual harassment were made in January against the former first minister, who strongly denies the claims.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was informed of an investigation in March.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Salmond, who has since resigned from the SNP, is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Scottish Government stressed no complaints had been recorded prior to January after claims that one of those complaints was first investigated in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Scottish Government spokesman said: "The Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond.</seg>
<seg id="8">These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.</seg>
<seg id="9">No complaints were raised with the then deputy first minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are confident our processes are legally sound and we will vigorously defend our position.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, as we have said previously, for legal reasons we can make no further comment on the issues relating to Mr Salmond at this time."</seg>
<seg id="13">A spokesman for Alex Salmond said: "We have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session and we expect it to be called shortly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We will do our talking in court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government's complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."</seg>

<seg id="1">Glasgow 29-13 Dragons: Lee Jones at double for Warriors</seg>
<seg id="2">Glasgow got back to winning ways in the Guinness Pro14 with a bonus-point victory over Dragons at Scotstoun as coach Dave Rennie expressed satisfaction but felt his side could have been more clinical.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the shock defeat by Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth the previous Saturday, Rennie had called for a response from a much-changed team and, while the maximum points were duly bagged to stay top of Conference A, it was far from emphatic in what was a disjointed encounter played in swirling wind and rain.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I thought our defence was excellent tonight, we played at the right end of the field and our setpiece was great," said Rennie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We need to be a bit more clinical, there were more opportunities that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was trying conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">We created lots of opportunities which we're happy about.</seg>
<seg id="8">We want to be more clinical but having said that if we had put 40 or 50 points on the board tonight that wouldn't have been good for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">We had to work for that.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bonus-point win but we need to be better next week at home to Zebre and the week after against Saracens in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">In windy conditions, Glasgow looked to have opened the scoring early but the TMO picked up the slightest of knock-ons from Huw Jones as he looked to have gathered Niko Matawalu's inside pass and gone over in the left corner.</seg>
<seg id="12">The frustration didn't last long as in the fourth minute loosehead prop Oli Kebble burst through the middle and Adam Hastings pinged over the easy conversion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dragons reduced the lead with a penalty from Arwel Robson and the stand-off knocked over another just after the 20-minute mark to bring the Welsh to within a point.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fairly tame opening half found some kind of life around the half-hour mark as Glasgow's forwards established a sustained siege of the Dragons line before South African referee Stuart Berry penalised the Welsh side for an offside tackle in the 22 on home stand-off Hastings.</seg>
<seg id="15">Warriors opted for the scrum but surrendered possession before putting together their most fluid passage of play, left wing Matawalu not quite able to keep control of the ball after some punchy surges and a sweeping passing move out left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second try finally came two minutes from the interval when Hastings pierced the Dragons line and then popped a clever pass out to Lee Jones, whose momentum saw him crash over.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hastings saw his conversion come back off the post to make it 12-6 at half-time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Glasgow got off to the best possible start in the first minute of the second half as Alex Dunbar's delicious offload in the tackle was gleefully gobbled up by Lee Jones for his second try, Hastings adding the extras.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, any sense that the Warriors would now run away with things received a setback just four minutes later when possession was coughed up in the midfield and a fly hack was followed up by Dragons centre Adam Warren who dribbled over to score under the posts, Josh Lewis, who had come on for Robson before the break, converting.</seg>
<seg id="20">Warriors swiftly reasserted dominance and the bonus-point fourth try came in the 54th minute as Huw Jones surged over down the right, Hastings falling short with the conversion - his third miss from four attempts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Glasgow remained in comfortable ascendancy and the fifth try came with a couple of minutes left as Dunbar got on the end of a sweet offload by sub scrum-half George Horne to cruise over and Hastings" boot completed the scoring.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kebble was awarded man of the match but Rennie praised Hastings.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They obviously didn't want us to play and were flying up in the middle," said the coach.</seg>
<seg id="24">"He probably needed to hold a couple of metres of depth but he's pretty slippery and managed to find some space in behind them.</seg>
<seg id="25">He's in a good vein of form and confident."</seg>

<seg id="3">Shankland swept Ayr into the lead from six yards after Michael Rose had headed a McDaid corner back across goal.</seg>
<seg id="4">Morton levelled with their first effort on target on 35 minutes when Charlie Telfer robbed a dithering Robbie Crawford inside his own box and sent a low shot arrowing past Ayr keeper Ross Doohan and into the far corner.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Greenock side were presented with a great opportunity to take the lead four minutes into the second half when Gary Oliver was sent tumbling by Doohan but Michael Tidser's penalty was weakly hit and easily gathered by the keeper.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ayr moved in front a second time on 74 minutes when a cross from substitute Craig McGuffie was deflected high into the air and when it fell to earth fellow replacement Craig Moore prodded home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Within a minute Moore cut the ball back for Shankland and the striker scored his 17th goal of the season.</seg>

<seg id="3">The series based on Eleanor Catton's Man Booker Prize-winning novel is to begin filming in November.</seg>
<seg id="4">The story takes place during the 1860s gold rush in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="5">Eleanor has written a series of brilliant screenplays.</seg>
<seg id="6">I loved her original novel and it's so exciting that her own screen adaptation reveals yet more exquisite material," Green said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I've had tremendous fun adapting this novel for the screen and feel incredibly lucky to be working with such fantastic people across different art forms," Catton added.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Writing a novel is a solitary business, but writing for the screen is emphatically collaborative, and to see the world of The Luminaries enlarged and enriched in ways that go far beyond the scope of my own imagination has been a humbling and hugely exhilarating experience.</seg>
<seg id="9">I couldn't be happier that the brilliant Claire McCarthy is at the helm, and I can't wait to see this incredible cast bring the story to life."</seg>

<seg id="1">Redshirt season no longer a possibility for Alabama's Hurts</seg>
<seg id="2">The idea of Alabama backup quarterback Jalen Hurts possibly redshirting this season came to an end Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hurts was inserted into Saturday's matchup for the top-ranked Crimson Tide against overmatched Louisiana, marking the fifth game he has appeared in this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">Per a new NCAA rule this season, a player can appear in as many as four games and still qualify for a redshirt season.</seg>
<seg id="5">A report by the Athletic earlier this month suggested Hurts was planning to take that route due to his frustration over the quarterback controversy and how it was handled by the team's coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tua Tagovailoa supplanted Hurts as the starter this season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he still plans to take advantage of Hurts' skill set.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hurts guided Alabama to the national championship game against Georgia last season, but he was replaced in the second half by Tagovailoa, who rallied the Crimson Tide to a 26-23 victory.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former SEC Offensive Player of the Year, Hurts entered this season having started the previous 28 games for Alabama, posting a 26-2 record.</seg>
<seg id="9">Entering Saturday's contest, Hurts completed 22 of 31 passes for 276 yards with four touchdowns and one interception in the Crimson Tide's first four games.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also rushed 15 times for 54 yards.</seg>

<seg id="1">Owens: Dez needs to act on idea of signing 'soon'</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant predicted he will "soon" be returning to the NFL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hall of Famer Terrell Owens said for Bryant's sake, that time can't come soon enough.</seg>
<seg id="4">Responding to a question on Twitter on when he plans to sign with a team, Bryant on Friday offered a one-word tweet: "Soon."</seg>
<seg id="5">A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bryant has been without a team since the Dallas Cowboys released him in mid-April in a salary dispute.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bryant, who reportedly rejected a contract offer from the Baltimore Ravens and has continually been linked to the Cleveland Browns, said just prior to the season that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with a team.</seg>
<seg id="7">Owens, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August and still makes noises about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant's focus should be on getting back on the field -- immediately.</seg>
<seg id="8">"He has to get on the team and prove to everyone what he feels like he is capable of doing," Owens told the website.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Because everybody, if you listen to all the commentators, they feel he's lost a step, he's not the guy he once was, that he feels like he is.</seg>
<seg id="10">At this point the game, get on a roster, no matter what the money is -- if its's a one-year deal, two-year deal, whatever the case may be -- and show everybody what you're made of, what you're capable of doing."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bryant had a team-leading 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns with Dallas in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 29-year-old has gone a career-long 23 regular-season games without a 100-yard performance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since signing a five-year, $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant has failed to record a 1,000-yard season or make more than eight touchdown receptions in a season.</seg>
<seg id="14">"From a general manager's or owner's standpoint, when they feel your skillset is declining, you're not going to warrant or garner that money you're really looking for," advised Owens,.</seg>
<seg id="15">Warning that if Bryant doesn't find his way onto a roster in the near future, "then it's not going to happen," Owens said the idea of a reunion with the struggling Cowboys should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Absolutely. I dont know if that relationship is fractured," said Owens, who had 38 touchdowns in three seasons with Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I think for Dez, if the Cowboys welcomed him back and he gets an opportunity, then that bodes well for Dez and the franchise."</seg>
