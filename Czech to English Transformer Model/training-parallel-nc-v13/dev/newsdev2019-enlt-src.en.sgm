<seg id="1">Rolling with the Ulster Lambretta Club</seg>
<seg id="2">Lambrettas were an essential accessory in the mod scene of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="3">The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts of the Italian motor scooter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 100 scooters from all over the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh this weekend, 70 years after the first Ulster Lambretta Club was formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chris Wilson, one of two members of the original club, bought his first Lambretta for around Â£40 in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="6">"A scooter was just to me a form of transport, but then there was the option to use it for other things.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bit of sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">I never did get into the mod scene and I'm probably far too old now for it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Basically it was relatively cheap, relatively reliable and they were available for the right amount of money and once you had one there were other things you could do with it other than just riding from A to B."</seg>
<seg id="10">He used to race Lambrettas in time trials around the TT circuit on the Isle of Man.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first Ulster Lambretta Club wound up in the early 1970s but it was reformed 12 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It started to die out around 1971, the interest in scooters, other forms of transport and the Troubles didn't help with clubs in general, so I thought, 'No that's it, finished'," Chris said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And then sometime back there were showings of the interest in it and it seems to have grown and grown."</seg>
<seg id="14">Philip Steele is the membership secretary of the Ulster Lambretta Club which currently has 97 members.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Everyone's got their own take.</seg>
<seg id="16">Obviously there'll be guys influenced from the whole mod scene, that's where a lot of it started.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other guys are into the racing scene, rockers, there's a mixture of everyone in it here.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people are just into the vintage thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many of the scooters have been customised and no two are the same.</seg>
<seg id="20">You can either keep them original and potter along at 35 or 40 mph they were originally designed to go around the small streets in Italy, but some of the guys have tuned these things.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of these bikes here probably could do upwards of 100 mph, the super tuned ones. "</seg>
<seg id="22">There were a few breakdowns and push starts over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="23">And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as the Lambretta's Italian home, the sun was shining as the scooters toured around County Fermanagh.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ruth Davidson calls for Tory Brexit 'silence'</seg>
<seg id="2">Ruth Davidson has called for a "period of silence" among her Conservative colleagues to allow the prime minister to get a Brexit deal "over the line."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Scottish Tory leader said the two years following the EU referendum had provided enough time for debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her comments follow Boris Johnson's description of the Chequers plan as "deranged and entirely preposterous."</seg>
<seg id="5">She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland it was now time to get behind the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="6">As Tory activists assembled in Birmingham for their party conference, she said: "There's been time over the last two years for debate.</seg>
<seg id="7">The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one."</seg>
<seg id="10">Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="11">Theresa May later insisted she did believe in Brexit, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 "the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event."</seg>
<seg id="13">Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: "In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for."</seg>

<seg id="1">Christine Blasey Ford's friend clarifies statement about alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh</seg>
<seg id="2">Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while they were both teenagers, has written a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee to clarify that although she does not remember the house party where the misconduct allegedly occurred, she believes Ford's account.</seg>
<seg id="3">Keyser had previously released a statement through her attorney saying that she did not remember the party in question, and that she does not remember ever meeting Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee Thursday, Kavanaugh often brought up Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, although he omitted that Keyser said that she believed Ford.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Trump instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation within one week on Friday, after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and other moderate senators called for a weeklong delay on a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation to give time for an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Keyser said through her lawyer in a letter to the committee that she was willing to "cooperate fully with the FBI's supplemental investigation" into Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="7">"However, as my client has already made clear, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford," the letter from Howard Walsh, Keyser's attorney, said.</seg>
<seg id="8">It continued that Keyser "does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account."</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question," the letter continued.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh's who was allegedly present during the assault, has also said that he will cooperate with the FBI investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wrongfully convicted Chicago residents recall life under corrupt cop and his "gang"</seg>
<seg id="2">The top prosecutor in Illinois is trying to turn the page from a dark period in Chicago police history.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's believed that one bad cop preyed on innocent residents of a housing project, rounding up dozens of people on bogus charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">So far, 42 wrongly convicted people have been exonerated.</seg>
<seg id="5">An empty lot is now all that's left of the Ida B. Wells housing project where a group of corrupt Chicago cops preyed almost risk-free on residents for most of a decade.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sergeant Ronald Watts was their ringleader.</seg>
<seg id="7">Residents have accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, filing false police reports, planting evidence and assault.</seg>
<seg id="8">Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those exonerated so far by Cook County state attorney Kim Foxx.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If you didn't cooperate with him, you was going down.</seg>
<seg id="10">You was against him.</seg>
<seg id="11">You was against his operation and his way of getting money," Cleon Glover said of Watts.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I was terrified.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was trying to get away, get out of that neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="14">I had nowhere to go," Willie Martin said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lawyers from Foxx's conviction integrity unit are reviewing 30 to 40 additional cases connected to Watts.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ida B. Wells housing resident Landon Allen said a lot of people spoke up about Watts.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Everybody spoke up," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"But it didn't matter."</seg>
<seg id="19">As Clarissa Baker, another former resident, pointed out, it was their word against a sergeant with a badge.</seg>
<seg id="20">"He has his own gang.</seg>
<seg id="21">So who would believe us?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Baker said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Joshua Tepfer of the University of Chicago's exoneration project says the answer until recently was no one.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They let it go on because they viewed these people as disposable and they didn't care because they're black people in the housing projects who in their minds were guilty of something anyway," Tepfer said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Sgt. Watts went to prison in 2013 and served 22 months for trying to steal from an FBI informant.</seg>
<seg id="26">Martez Wise went to prison too - because of Watts.</seg>
<seg id="27">During that time I had just had my son.</seg>
<seg id="28">I was away from him for four years.</seg>
<seg id="29">He barely even know who I was because he was just born, so I had to re-bond with him," Wise said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Four years taken away for nothing."</seg>

<seg id="1">72-year-old Fidelity bets on the future with blockchain, virtual reality and AI</seg>
<seg id="2">Fidelity recognized the potential in blockchain before it became the corporate buzzword of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="3">CEO Abby Johnson led the charge into cryptocurrency, one of the riskiest and most volatile asset classes of the past year.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A few plus years ago, myself and a few other senior executives here were just curious about what was going on, particularly with bitcoin," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="5">We started getting together to say 'we're got to understand this.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The curiosity led them to start bitcoin "mining," at a location in New Hampshire when the crypto's price was around $180.</seg>
<seg id="7">Flash forward to December of last year when bitcoin rose to almost $20,000, "behold - the price goes up and all the sudden we're making money, which was never the intent," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She did not specify how much bitcoin has been mined, or how much money Fidelity made.</seg>
<seg id="9">There's clear interest in the topic by Fidelity employees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Its blockchain club for employees called "bits and blocks," hosts seminars, office hours and meet ups, now has roughly 2,600 members.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company has an arrangement with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity mobile app.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2015, it started facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many other potential uses for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been scrapped by now or "put on the shelf," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">We're trying to listen to the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the meantime, Katie Chase, the head of strategy for Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and head of the Blockchain Incubator (which is a part of FCAT), is exploring uses for both public blockchain and enterprise blockchain.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chase could not comment specifically on the projects but said she's seen massive interest from clients and partners, as well as their own employees.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's still very nascent.</seg>
<seg id="18">All of the stuff that you're reading about, if you dig under the covers is still in the proof of concept stage," Chase said.</seg>
<seg id="19">We tried to apply blockchain to some use cases where we learned a lot but the technology isn't mature enough to solve these problems."</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, the group is more focused on what some of those barriers are, she said.</seg>
<seg id="21">They're looking at how to "tokenize" physical items, like a piece of art for example, or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Those are on the shelf, but we think they'll eventually come off," Chase said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Fidelity will be well-equipped when they do."</seg>
<seg id="24">She used the example of Pebble watch, a failure by retail standards but something that paid off for Fidelity.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her group had created an app for the smartwatch, which shut down three years after raising millions through a crowdfunded kickstarter campaign.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the Apple Watch finally came to market, Fidelity was ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">It used the app developed for Pebble to quickly go live on Apple's new product.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We were not betting that the Pebble watch is the next big thing - but in case we have people wearing these things on their wrist, we wanted to be there too," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It gave us the learning for when the smart watch did go to mass market, and we were able to be there."</seg>

<seg id="3">"We are a campus that prides itself on inclusion and embraces diversity," Principal Adriana Lepe-Ramirez said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will not tolerate actions that send messages of racism and promote divisiveness."</seg>
<seg id="5">The statement said Escondido High School, district officials and local police were investigating the incident, the station reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Parents and guardians of the students involved are being contacted by school administrators, and appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken," the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="7">During the senior picnic, students at the school north of San Diego wear lettered shirts and are photographed spelling out words while standing side by side, the station reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">The words are usually approved ahead of time but some students spell out their own words after the official photo is taken.</seg>
<seg id="9">The district statement said the activity was "not aligned with Escondido High School's culture, values or history."</seg>
<seg id="10">"We all need to understand the power of our words and actions, and we must take responsibility for the decisions we make each and every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Track Palin, 28, was arrested on three charges, including assault</seg>
<seg id="3">Sunday's incident is not his first arrest related to domestic violence</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened at the Palin home in Wasilla, Alaska, where Track Palin bloodied his father, Todd, in a dispute over a truck, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 28-year-old was arrested on three charges, including assault, after the incident Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The dispute began when he called to say he wanted to come get the truck, and his father refused, according to court documents.</seg>
<seg id="7">Track Palin was arrested on charges of first-degree burglary, fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal mischief, and his father suffered injuries to his face and head, the court filing shows.</seg>
<seg id="8">Track Palin called the officers on the scene "peasants" and told them to abandon their weapons when they attempted to communicate with him, the documents say.</seg>
<seg id="9">At one point, he got onto the garage roof before eventually being detained, the court filing says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sarah Palin said her son was "freaking out" and "was on some type of medication," according to the court documents.</seg>
<seg id="11">Track Palin also told the police he had consumed a few beers earlier, the documents say.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence assault involving a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.</seg>

<seg id="4">She was the girlfriend of James Lyle, 57, a millionaire hedge fund boss and former Conservative Party donor, who met the five-figure cost for her care.</seg>

<seg id="11">Ms Gollop, acting for Ava Vidal, said: "My client would like to piece together what was happening to Shaquelle... to understand who it was she was in contact with, and what she was doing."</seg>
<seg id="12">She referred to Mr Lyle as Shaquelle's "boyfriend."</seg>
<seg id="13">Comedy director John Gordillo, 52, who was described as Shaquelle's "unofficial stepfather," said: "I know Shaquelle was still in contact with James Lyle, and he was based in New York at the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Gordillo told the hearing that on April 4 he called the hospital "more than a dozen times" in 20 minutes after Shaquelle rang him to claim she wanted to buy and take cyanide, but that no one answered.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It seems to me that, had someone picked up during that period, what followed could have been avoided," he added.</seg>
<seg id="16">On April 5, a doctor at the hospital assessed Shaquelle as being "acutely psychiatrically unwell."</seg>
<seg id="17">Less than 48 hours later, she hanged herself using a laptop cable.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Nightingale spokesman extended sympathy to her family and friends and said: "Our hospital is committed to providing high standards of care in a safe and therapeutic environment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Police chase ends when Michigan cop runs down murder suspect as he shoots at officers</seg>
<seg id="2">A Michigan man suspected of murdering his girlfriend has been arrested after leading police on a chase that ended when he was mowed down by a police car.</seg>
<seg id="3">Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected of shooting dead his girlfriend Tia Mae Randall, 27, Thursday in Wyoming, Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was arraigned Friday in a hospital where he is being treated after an officer ran him down with a police SUV as Nolin shot at them while trying to flee on a busy highway.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nolin has been charged with five felony counts including assault with intent to murder and fleeing police.</seg>
<seg id="6">'Arraigning at the hospital certainly isn't the norm, but it's not unheard of either,' Wyoming Police Capt. James Maguffee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">'He is getting the treatment he needs, but we need the wheels of justice to turn.</seg>
<seg id="8">Judges will often make the accommodations to make that happen.'</seg>
<seg id="9">The body of Nolin's girlfriend was found Thursday morning at Creekside Estates mobile home.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother-of-two was killed by a single gunshot and police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police then released an alert for the public to be on lookout for Nolin, giving a broad physical description of him and his 1996 black Dodge pickup truck.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was spotted in his trick and as police tried to pull him over Nolin hopped onto US 131.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nolin crashed his truck into a concrete median then got out and ran on foot down the highway.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he ran, Nolin shot at the officers chasing him.</seg>
<seg id="15">One cop took the police SUV and ran Nolin down from behind.</seg>
<seg id="16">The event was captured on video by an onlooker.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was transported to the hospital where he is in serious but stable condition and will remain until he is discharged and transferred to Kent County Jail.</seg>
<seg id="18">'It shows the willingness of our police officers in West Michigan to put themselves in harm's way to protect this community,' Maguffee said.</seg>
<seg id="19">'They got the guy in custody in an appropriate time frame and in an appropriate way and we're very proud of them.'</seg>
<seg id="20">In all, Nolin is charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder, fleeing police, carrying a concealed weapon and felony use of a firearm.</seg>
<seg id="21">He has yet to be charged in the death of his girlfriend as the homicide investigation remains active.</seg>
<seg id="22">'There's absolutely an underlying homicide investigation that continues and we'll be close to wrapping that up and we'll present that to the Kent County prosecutor at the appropriate time,' Maguffee said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge heaps praise on brave homeowner who knocked burglar's teeth out during break-in at his home</seg>
<seg id="2">A judge has praised a householder who confronted two thugs trying to break into his home - giving him "full marks" for bravery.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite one offender swinging a plank of wood at him, 63-year-old David Oldham refused to be cowed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead, the university estates manager fought back, punching both offenders and knocking one of the men's teeth out.</seg>
<seg id="5">The criminals fled but blood left on Mr Oldham from the scuffle led to one of them, Craig Ford, being identified and arrested four months later.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sentencing Ford, who lost a tooth after being hit by Mr Oldham outside his Â£400,000 detached home in Ormskirk, Lancashire, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, told him: "Mr Oldham gave you more than you bargained for because when he confronted you at the side of his house, disguised so only your eyes and nose were visible, he punched you.</seg>
<seg id="7">And not only did he punch you but when your accomplice, who had been breaking in upstairs, jumped down from the roof he punched him as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jailing Ford for three years and four months on Friday, the judge said: "You've learnt two lessons, I hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">One is you do not mess with David Oldham, and two, you don't mess with the police.</seg>
<seg id="10">For your pains in committing these offences you now have one tooth less than you had before and you got bitten by a dog.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the least you deserve."</seg>
<seg id="12">He added: "Full marks to Mr Oldham for the way in which he responded to what you did."</seg>
<seg id="13">Derek Jones, prosecuting, said that at the time of the burglary, Ford was on licence from a three-year sentence imposed in 2016, also for burglary.</seg>
<seg id="14">Liverpool Crown Court heard Mr Oldham sprang into action when he heard noises outside his home at about 7pm on April 5.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Jones said: "Mr Oldham, a man of some substance, bravely went out to the side of the property and was confronted by the defendant who moved towards him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fearing for his safety he punched him once to the face which knocked him to the floor and also knocked a tooth out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other intruder then jumped down from the roof landing in front of Mr Oldham who instinctively punched him to the face."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Jones said the accomplice picked up a plank of wood and swung it at Mr Oldham, and Ford said: "Shoot him, he's knocked my teeth out."</seg>
<seg id="19">The accomplice said to Mr Oldham: "We'll just leave it now if you let us go," and he and Ford fled the scene.</seg>
<seg id="20">Police caught up with Ford when they raided a house in Wavertree on August 2.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ford kicked out at a police dog, which then bit his shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="22">The second burglar is believed to be still at large.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ford, 25, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to burglary, assault by beating, and driving dangerously while disqualified and without a licence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Blow for Boris as Tory activists CLAP attack on him in conference hall</seg>
<seg id="2">Boris Johnson suffered a blow today as Tory activists clapped a vicious attack on him as 'irrelevant and offensive'.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite Mr Johnson wooing the grass roots with his hardline approach to Brexit, the brutal assessment from former trade minister Digby Jones went down well with members at conference in Birmingham this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, David Davis swiped that Mr Johnson was focused on 'headlines' rather than sound policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">And a Cabinet ally of Mrs May added to the woes by telling MailOnline that he was only making so much 'noise' because he did not have the 'numbers' for an all-out leadership bid.</seg>
<seg id="6">The backlash came after the former foreign secretary launched another vicious attack on the PM's Chequers plan for Brexit - branding it 'deranged' and 'preposterous'.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Johnson upped the ante by pointing out that she was a Remainer during the referendum two years ago - whereas he is a true believer in the project.</seg>
<seg id="8">And he urged the government to back ambitious projects like building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">But a defiant Mrs May shot back that her critics were 'playing politics' and insisted she is 'not bluffing' about driving a hard bargain with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="10">Speaking during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show to kick off Tory conference, Mrs May said: 'I do believe in Brexit.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Lord Jones, a former Labour trade minister who now sits as an independent, pleased the crowd by praising the opportunities of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he prompted applause by referring to alleged remarks by Mr Johnson when he responded 'f*** business' in response to questions about the concerns they have raised.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without naming Mr Johnson, Lord Jones took aim at the 'irrelevant and offensive person he really is'.</seg>
<seg id="14">'Business is so important that when I heard a former foreign secretary say "f*** business," it showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">'I take great exception to that.'</seg>
<seg id="16">Lord Jones also hailed the response by Mrs May - who watched the speech from the hall - to 'bullying' by EU leaders over her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also took aim at Mr Johnson, pointing out that he had stayed as a senior member of the government during the Brexit negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Cabinet ally of Mrs May played down the intervention, telling MailOnline that Mr Johnson does not have enough support among Tory MPs to oust the PM.</seg>
<seg id="19">They said: "It is not that damaging to have stories like this in the papers today.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is making a lot of noise, but Boris does not have the numbers in the parliamentary party, and he knows that is the case.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a big contrast between the respectful stance David Davis has taken, arguing his case, and the way Boris has pursued his own personal ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Business Secretary Greg Clark lashed Mr Johnson for attacking business for being sceptical about Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Speaking on the fringes of the Tory conference in Birmingham, Mr Clark said Mr Johnson's jibe was "totally the wrong thing to say."</seg>
<seg id="24">He said: "I was surprised that anyone could even think like that.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is no successful economy anywhere in the world that does not have successful and flourishing businesses.</seg>
<seg id="26">In an interview with Sky News' Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis admitted that the next couple of months would be 'really scary' as the EU tried to force deep concessions from the UK.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he said the government had to hold its nerve and push for a Canada-style agreement rather than Chequers.</seg>
<seg id="28">He also delivered a stinging barb when asked about Mr Johnson's attractions as a Tory leader.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ridiculing Mr Johnson's proposal of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said 'one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas'.</seg>
<seg id="30">He added: 'We have a very knockabout friendships, but quite a lot of his ideas are good headlines but not good policies.'</seg>

<seg id="2">V.Dargis was born on 2 August, 1926 in the village of Pakempiniai in AkmenÄ district.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of the Second World War, in 1944, avoiding the Soviets, he traveled to the West from Kaunas, where he studied and lived, and in 1947 he settled in England.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 1992 he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 1952-1957 V.Dargis was the head of the publishing house âNida Pressâ in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 1954, he founded the "Nida" book club there and led it until 1957 and again from 1983 to 1991.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newspaper "British Lithuanian" (later "European Lithuanian") and other publications of Lithuanians in Great Britain were printed at "Nida" book club printing house.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Nida Book Club" had released the latest works by Lithuanian writers living in the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 1959-1961 V.Dargis worked as the newsreader, director and journalist of the U.S. radio "The Voice of America" (Munich).</seg>
<seg id="10">V.Dargis worked for the Board of Directors of the Lithuanian House in London for a long time, to which he was elected in 1956-1957, in 1982 he was the director of the press department, in 1984-1986 - the chairman of the board, and in 1984-1987 he was the administrator responsible for the renovation of the Lithuanian publishing house in Great Britain, served as the head of the affairs in the Lithuanian House.</seg>

<seg id="15">At the beginning of 1994, as an addendum to the "European Lithuanian", the monthly "Lithuanian Dreams" was launched on the initiative of V.Dargis and at his own expense, and it was distributed free of charge together with the "European Lithuanian" among the Lithuanians of Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the founders' decision, the publication of "European Lithuanian" was returned to Great Britain at the beginning of 1996.</seg>
<seg id="17">While living in Great Britain, V.Dargis always hoped to return to independent Lithuania, therefore he welcomed the restored independence of Lithuania.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poll: who has the biggest chance to win in the second round of the presidential election?</seg>
<seg id="2">The poll regarding the second round of elections included four top candidates: economist Gitanas NausÄda, the Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, who has not proclaimed himself as the candidate, and two candidates who had participated in the initial elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) - Member of the Parliament Ingrida Å imonytÄ and diplomat Vygaudas UÅ¡ackas.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, on Sunday it turned out that I.Å imonytÄ received TS-LKD support and V.UÅ¡ackas has withdrawn from the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to data, if elections were held in the near future, G.NausÄda would win the second round of the presidential election in all cases, but the head of âVilmorusâ, sociologist Vladas Gaidys says it is too early to make conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"NausÄda stands out (from others - DELFI), but it is very important to watch, whether we talk about the parties or about people, what is the dynamics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The double increase for Å imonytÄ was apparent between the surveys, and there was a halt for NausÄda. UÅ¡ackasâ results even decreased.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, this increase is very importantâ, says sociologist.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, according to the results of the survey, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided who they will vote for, or they are not planning to vote at all.</seg>
<seg id="9">If I.Å imonytÄ and S.Skvernelis meet in the second round of presidential elections, the struggle would be tense - 32.7% would vote for I.Å imonytÄ, and 30.9% for S.Skvernelis.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, even 36.4% of the people said they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know who to vote for, or they would not vote at all.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sociologist V.Gaidys once again emphasized that we are not seeing a full picture so far, because not all candidates who would apply to the less successful electorate of Lithuania have proclaimed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, so where are their candidates?</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, where is a candidate of the social democrats? They had a candidate for 30 years, wonât there be any now?</seg>
<seg id="14">When they proclaim themselves, it will be clear what are their chances compared with other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, the less successful part of Lithuania is less reflected so farâ, says V.Gaidys.</seg>
<seg id="16">In turn, MaÅ¾vydas Jastramskis, a political scientist at Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI), says that it's still too early to make conclusions, and all three candidates, excluding V.UÅ¡ackas who left the fight, look similar.</seg>
<seg id="17">"From my research experience, these differences do not mean anything.</seg>
<seg id="18">A difference of 5 percentage points really does not show the advantage of any candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">The only thing I could see that NausÄda would look good against UÅ¡ackas (...) again, bearing in mind that if those people actually came to vote.</seg>
<seg id="20">NausÄda also looks good against Skvernelis, but we are comparing apples and potatoes now, because, for example, NausÄda has already announced that he will participate, and Skvernelis has not.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, the poll took part before the initial elections by conservatives, how would it look after the elections?", says a political scientist.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to him, G.NausÄda has a small advantage, but once all candidates have proclaimed themselves, it can decrease.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The situation is quite similar.</seg>
<seg id="24">NausÄda, Skvernelis, Å imonytÄ - the results are quite even.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would like to remind you that Roland Paksas had a 5% support half a year before the 2003 presidential election, and then he won the election.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's not possible to make any predictions", says Jastramskis.</seg>
<seg id="27">DELFI reminds that candidates for the presidential elections so far are the following: economist G.NausÄda, member of the Parliament I.Å imonytÄ, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist and member of the Parliament AuÅ¡ra MaldeikienÄ, member of the Liberal Movement Petras AuÅ¡treviÄius, member of the Parliament Naglis Puteikis and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eligijus Masiulis will not get the money that was confiscated during the search</seg>
<seg id="2">The Court of Appeal announced on Tuesday that it would reject the complaint of the defendantâs lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="3">The order is final and can not be appealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">E.Masiulis, the former leader of the Liberal Movement, who is tried in a political corruption case, approached the Court of Appeal, asking to return his personal money that was taken from his and his spouse's wallets during the search.</seg>
<seg id="5">In total, more than 242,000 euros were taken from E.Masiulis during the searches.</seg>
<seg id="6">This money is subject to a temporary restriction of ownership right which is continuously renewed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The restriction was last extended by Vilnius District Court on October 15.</seg>
<seg id="8">E. Masiulis did not ask the Court of Appeal to return all the money â he wants to get 800 euros that were taken from his spouseâs wallet as well as 690 euros, 130 pound sterlings and 1,600 US dollars taken from his wallet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Former politician says that the money was intended for the planned trip to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">E. Masiulisâ lawyer Mindaugas Bliuvas, at the Court of Appeal on Monday, asked for the return of the money, as the spouses had well-paid jobs and could have such amounts of money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to reject the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The decision of the Vilnius District Court is legal and valid, there is no further restriction on the property specified in the accusations.</seg>
<seg id="13">The court have justly stated that it had formed the basis for confiscation of the property as well as the extended confiscation of the property", said J.Laucius at the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="14">On October 15, Vilnius District Court decided not to return more than 242,000 euros to E.Masiulis, the accused in the political corruption case.</seg>
<seg id="15">This money was found during searches at home and in the car of the former politician who is accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The panel of three judges stated that it was clear from the file that the ownership rights were restricted only to the funds that constitute the subject of the criminal offenses incriminated to E.Masiulis.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Given the scope of the restriction, it follows that the ownership right of the accused is not restricted in a disproportionate manner or that the restriction has been applied for too long," stated judges NijolÄ Å½imkienÄ, Jurgita KolyÄienÄ and Ugnius Trumpulis in their decision.</seg>
<seg id="18">The judges pointed out that E.Masiulis was charged with serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex, therefore, in order to ensure possible confiscation of the property and extended confiscation of the property, it is necessary to extend the temporary restriction of the defendant's property.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prosecutors state that Raimondas Kurlianskis, the former vice president of âMG Balticâ, gave a bribe of 106,000 euros to E.Masiulis for taking decisions at the Seimas that are beneficial to the group.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both defendants say that money found at E.Masiulis - 90,000 euros - was a loan from R.Kurlianskis.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the case, 242,400 euros, 130 pound sterlings and 1,600 US dollars were found at E.Masiulis during the searches.</seg>
<seg id="22">E. Masiulis and his lawyer tried to recover the money more than once, but the courts rejected their requests.</seg>
<seg id="23">Former politician has said that part of these funds belong to other individuals and were to be invested in real estate, or that it was his family's money.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also argued that there is no evidence that the funds were received in a criminal way.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the past, the Court of Appeal had declared that the charges against E.Masiulis show that the money could have been received when he was accepting the bribe, which was more than 100,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="26">Law enforcement claims that the remaining cash taken during the search could have been obtained from undefined sources of income, could be not declared, not confirmed by the documents and not legal.</seg>
<seg id="27">The charges in the political corruption case were filed against three legal entities - the Labor Party, the Liberal Movement, and âMG Balticâ.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition to E.Masiulis, charges were also filed against former labourist Vytautas GapÅ¡ys, former member of the Parliament and liberal Å arÅ«nas Gustainis, member of the Parliament Gintaras SteponaviÄius and former vice-president of âMG Balticâ Raimondas Kurlianskis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parentâs expenses are not declining: up to 50 euros per month is spent for extra-curricular activities</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company âBaltijos tyrimaiâ, a poll carried out at the end of August revealed that this year one third (32%) of parents spent less than 100 euros on the purchases for one school-age child before going back to school, one fifth (21%) spent 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) - 151 to 200 euros, and less than one fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros at the end of the summer to prepare their child for school.</seg>
<seg id="3">Parents, whose children started their first year of school, spent about 220 euros on average on their childâs school necessities, while other parents, whose children had already completed first grade, allocated less money for their child - about 160 euros on average.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, spending does not decrease as the school year continues, as parents often have to spend on their children's activities and tutors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Depending on the nature of the activity, the cost for one activity varies from 20 to 100 euros in the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">Parents, who have schoolchildren, were asked to tell the average amount they plan to spend on one child's extra-curricular activity per month.</seg>
<seg id="7">One quarter (23%) of the respondents was planning to spend up to 20 euros per month on a child's extra-curricular activity, another quarter (26%) claimed they would pay up to 50 euros; three out of ten (31%) would spend between 50 and 100 euros per month for a child's extra-curricular activity, and one sixth (17%) of parents indicated that they plan to spend 100 euros or more.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, school-age children in Lithuania receive a non-formal education basket, which is 15 euros per month.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the money can only be used for one activity, and if the cost of the activity is higher, the difference must be paid by the parents.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a child attends several activities or there are several schoolchildren in a family, the cost of extra-curricular activities can double.</seg>
<seg id="11">Justina AmbrasienÄ, marketing manager of the consumer credit company âVivus.ltâ, says that saving money for childrenâs activities can be a big challenge for families with low or average income, especially if there are several children in the family.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the school year, parents were thinking where to get money for exercise books, stationery or new sportswear.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the main concern is how to keep children busy after school without spending a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="14">We notice that parents' expenses especially increase in August, when it is necessary to get ready for the new academic year, but later they also remain higher than during the summer, as parents tend to invest in the activity of their offspring.</seg>
<seg id="15">Often, when they lack funds and after responsible assessment of their possibilities, they even decide to borrow", says J.AmbrasienÄ.</seg>

<seg id="2">Today, the fourth exhibit of the mobile street exhibition "Bye old things, hello new things" is running on the streets of Kaunas - the old trolleybus was decorated with a drawing and the inscription âSienografo uÅ¾raÅ¡aiâ.</seg>
<seg id="3">A new fun trolleybus was announced by Kaunas City Municipality.</seg>
<seg id="4">âThis old âÅ kodaâ has also changed its boring green color to a much more colorful and distinctive look.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is also a participant of the exhibition "Bye old things, hello new things", explained municipality representatives next to the uploaded photo.</seg>
<seg id="6">The exhibition of mobile street art "Bye old things, hello new things" is dedicated to parting with the old trolleybuses that will be replaced by new ones next year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Next year, the old âÅ kodaâ trolleybuses will go to well-deserved retirement, and will be replaced by 85 new and modern âSolarisâ trolleybuses.</seg>
<seg id="8">The portal reminds that the first trolleybus with street drawings appeared on the streets of Kaunas a month ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several well known accents of Kaunas street art are shown on the trolleybus - the old man's tobacco pipe and the elephant.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a week after the first appearance, the second creation of street artist Timotiejus Norvila - Morfai went out to Kaunas streets.</seg>
<seg id="11">A fun yellow car is painted on the trolleybus, often referred to simply as a "beetle".</seg>
<seg id="12">"The idea was to make the trolleybus site-specific.</seg>
<seg id="13">This drawing looks very entertaining, especially because it matches with the wheels of the trolleybus.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the wheels roll, it appears to be a part of that car.</seg>
<seg id="15">When we painted the wheels in white, we made them look like retro style, and the whole combination became very harmonized.</seg>
<seg id="16">While the trolleybusâ tires were not painted, it was definitely not so charmingâ, the street artist told the portal âkauno.diena.ltâ earlier.</seg>
<seg id="17">On October 27, the magnificent drawing also appeared on the third trolleybus.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is painted in white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.</seg>
<seg id="19">This colour is dominant.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the left side of the trolleybus body there is one of the houses on K. DonelaiÄio street, and on the right is the central post office.</seg>
<seg id="21">âThe âBeetleâ is still my favouriteâ, said Morfai while painting the third trolleybus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Going to buy new ones</seg>
<seg id="23">âKauno dienaâ reminds that last week Kaunas public transport company âKauno autobusaiâ signed a 29.4 million contract with the Polish company âSolaris Bus & Coach S.A.â stating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Kaunas has invested the largest amount in public transport renewal in its entire history.</seg>
<seg id="25">This agreement will allow to replace the old trolleybuses of the âÅ kodaâ brand, which has been serving us for many years, and to offer the most comfortable services to our passengers.</seg>
<seg id="26">New low-floor modern trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient cabin air conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driverâs workplace.</seg>
<seg id="27">The new technology and parallel upgrade of the contact network as well as street repair will allow trolleybuses to run more reliably and much faster.</seg>
<seg id="28">And, of course, modern trolleybuses will improve the image of the city", said Mindaugas Grigelis, General Manager of âKauno autobusaiâ.</seg>
<seg id="29">First new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exhibition âWomanâs Worldâ is coming back to "Å½algiris" arena</seg>
<seg id="2">With the autumn routine and more savage weather, the exhibition "Women's World" that is being organized for the 16th time makes one feel impatient - women declare a long weekend, because four days of the hottest fashion, style and beauty news are coming - on November 8-11, in Kaunas "Å½algiris" arena.</seg>
<seg id="3">Over the years, the face of the event has changed, and the exhibition no longer means an ordinary shopping, but the tradition of having time to oneself.</seg>
<seg id="4">Often it becomes the place to meet friends and a reason to spend a day with sister or mother.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four days of the exhibition have a special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn how to shine everyday, find the irreplaceable products, hear or try out various procedures that stop the aging process of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="6">All this, and more, is promised by 415 participants of the exhibition who will wait for the visitors on all three floors of the arena.</seg>
<seg id="7">For three days, workshops will be held on beauty and health topics, and on Sunday women will hear tips on creating an exclusive image from the lips of stylist and blogger Viktorija Å aulytÄ.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many women in business face situations, when stress impairs stable emotional and physical condition.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this reason, Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and its Women's Business Network had the idea to hold a conference âEntrepreneurial And Happy. No stressâ, where discussions and practical examples will encourage to help oneself in tense situations and to look at life more creatively.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like every year, the exhibition is full of events for the masters of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="11">The long-term partners of the exhibition, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Specialists, will give an opportunity to study hair dyeing and modeling subtleties from the international academy "Vinokurov & friends" and their charismatic duo - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas for two days.</seg>
<seg id="12">For those who want to make a further progress, a bridal image creation contest and competition of masters âArt Battleâ will be held, which will not leave anyone indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="13">A cherry on a cake will be a celebratory fiesta "Happy Birthday, Lithuania" held by the representatives of the beauty world for the 100th anniversary, where one can admire a never-before-seen show - from body painting to dancing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another tradition of the "Woman's World" will not be forgotten - the presentation of the latest designersâ collections at "Fashion and Beauty Show" on Friday, where the most stylish people will gather.</seg>
<seg id="15">And those who like handicrafts will be welcome at the "Dekostudija" creative workshop, where they can create original articles for home interior or to decorate gifts in a more interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the last day of the exhibition, all long-haired ladies are especially welcome, as the traditional contest âLONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018â will be held, where the new record of the longest hair is recorded annually.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prime Minister: the salary of teachers has increased by 117 euros after the introduction of full-time payment</seg>
<seg id="2">Since the introduction of full-time payment model in September, the average salaries of full-time teachers of the country have increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It's too early to say how many advantages or disadvantages it (new order - BNS) has.</seg>
<seg id="4">The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their salaries grew by more than 117 euros on averageâ, said S.Skvernelis to the journalists at the Government on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called the plans of the Lithuanian Education Employees Trade Union (LEETU) to go on strike regarding the full-time payment "a democratic right", but emphasized that strike should not interfere with the educational process.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permissible and possible.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they think that the strike is necessary - it is their right to decide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Again, we would not want this to impact children and pupils.</seg>
<seg id="9">If there is a strike, this must be done in accordance with the applicable law", said S.Skvernelis.</seg>
<seg id="10">In June, Seimas approved a model of full-time payment for teachers, which is being introduced in phases since September.</seg>
<seg id="11">Payment for teachers by a lesson was changed by hourly payment - a teacher's full-time job is 1512 hours a year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Teacher's working hours are divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.</seg>
<seg id="13">The union led by Andrius Navickas calls this reform an absurd, they are angry that it was adopted on the basis of the "bulldozer" principle and announced an indefinite strike that would start on November 12.</seg>
<seg id="14">LEETU demands the immediate abandonment of this "minute" salary system and the introduction of a full-time model with a maximum of 18 contact hours per post.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, to increase the fixed part of the salary by 20%, and to reduce the number of children in classes.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of teaching funds has been criticized, because, according to the trade union, there are not enough funds for home schooling, dividing classes into groups, qualification, education aid, and the classes in large cities remain overfilled.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ministry of Education and Science argued that full-time payment for teachers' work will help to regulate the workload of teachers and compensate for all work for the school community.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is anticipated that work for the community can make up to half of all hours per year in a teacher's full-time employment, which would constitute up to 40 percent of all hours in the first two years of work.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is established that the teachers' working time per week is 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact hours per week are required for teaching mandatory subject (subjects).</seg>
<seg id="20">In May, about fifty secondary schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions, and about 1 thousand teachers participated in a two-hour strike initiated by LEETU.</seg>
<seg id="21">In total, there are about 53 thousand teachers in Lithuania.</seg>

<seg id="1">Calls to be ready: the crisis can be expected in 2-3 years</seg>
<seg id="2">The slowdown in the economic growth and even a crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than the decade ago, said Vitas Vasiliauskas, the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, in a broadcast âThe Position Of Businessâ of the radio station "Å½iniÅ³ radijas".</seg>
<seg id="3">"I cannot say that the crisis is already around the corner, but there are signs of a slowdown in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="4">This year, our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, and next year we plan a 2.8 percent growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main message that I would like to say to the public and business is to be ready for everything", said V.Vasiliauskas.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his opinion, no crisis is the same, so the preparation for them must be different.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, during the crisis a decade ago, the government thought that the revenue generated by the emerging economy would be eternal, and the expenditure was planned accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, in 2008, following a crisis, there was a dramatic reduction in costs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, according to V.Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the preparation for crisis is better.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is true, we see that the assessment of the situation between the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.</seg>
<seg id="11">We believe that we are already exceeding the potential and need to press on the brakes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so", said the chairman of the board of the Bank of Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="13">V.Vasiliauskas assesses the readiness of the authorities of the country for the coming crisis 7 out of 10 points.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to him, being such small and open, Lithuanian economy is very strongly influenced by external factors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The current hustle of the big elephants - the USA, China, and European Union - will surely impact us, too.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, we need to be very careful.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is possible to say that we can solve everything in a small economy, but I do not believe it", said V.Vasiliauskas.</seg>
<seg id="18">What to expect in the future for those who have big loans?</seg>
<seg id="19">According to V.Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly arranged a short-term strategy, and changes in interest-rate decisions can be expected not earlier than in the summer of the next year: "At the moment, the main goal is to try to manage expectations."</seg>
<seg id="20">The trend, which is the most worrisome to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is a decrease in labor force in our country.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The decrease in labor force also largely determines the loss of economic competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, it is a decrease in bread eaters.</seg>
<seg id="23">Migration this year has somewhat balanced this process, but it is unclear whether this is a long-term trend", says Vasiliauskas.</seg>
<seg id="24">ELTA reminds that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow 3.4% this year, and 2.8% next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Swedish conservative leader will try to form government again</seg>
<seg id="2">The leader of Sweden's conservative Moderates party will get a second chance to form a government, the speaker of parliament said on Monday, two months after elections produced political deadlock.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ulf Kristersson's Moderates are part of the centre-right four-party Alliance which received marginally fewer votes on September 9 elections than the previous governing centre-left coalition.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both blocs have struggled to form a majority after refusing to make a deal with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which has roots in the neo-Nazi movement.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.Kristersson failed in his first bid to form a government on October 14.</seg>
<seg id="6">Outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Lofven then said he had also failed on October 29.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a bid to force the parties to reach an agreement, speaker Andreas Norlen said he would propose U.Kristersson to the parliament as a candidate for prime minister next week, pushing the issue to a vote for the first time since the efforts began to form a government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's not clear in advance whether various parties are going to accept Ulf Kristersson as prime minister," A.Norlen told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="9">But he stressed that "the process must move forward, the dynamics between the parties has to change.â</seg>
<seg id="10">âThe fruitless talks must come to an end", he added.</seg>
<seg id="11">The date for parliament's vote is not yet known, but A. Norlen said November 14 was a possibility.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Sweden, the speaker has four attempts to task a candidate to form a government that parliament will accept.</seg>
<seg id="13">If all four attempts fail, then Sweden must hold new elections.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nominating U.Kristersson is A.Norlen's third attempt.</seg>
<seg id="15">U.Kristersson is under pressure from some sections of the Moderates and from Alliance partner the Christian Democrats to accept support from the far-right Sweden Democrats to obtain a majority, but he has so far ruled that out.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Sweden Democrats, who won 17.6% of votes in the election and are the third-biggest party, have long been ignored by all mainstream parties.</seg>
<seg id="17">The far-right party, which successfully used the voters' anger over immigration through the elections, after the arrival of almost 400 thousand asylum seekers since 2012, require influence in decision-making in exchange for the support.</seg>
<seg id="18">But two other Alliance members, the Liberals and Centre Party, are vehemently opposed to that idea.</seg>
<seg id="19">S.Lofven's Social Democrats, who have governed since 2014 with the Greens and with the informal support of the Left, have meanwhile opened the door for a cross-bloc cooperation, but only if he retains the post of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Alliance and Sweden Democrats have rejected that option.</seg>

<seg id="1">Afghan government delegation to attend peace talks in Russia</seg>
<seg id="2">Kabulâs government delegation will attend international talks on the war-torn country in Russia this month, officials said on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Taliban is still considering whether to participate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russia announced on Saturday that it would host such conference on November 9 in Moscow, even as the United States tries to engage the Taliban in bilateral talks to end the 17-year conflict.</seg>
<seg id="5">Afghanistan's High Peace Council, a government body responsible for reconciliation efforts with the militants, would send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, spokesman Sayed Ihsan Taheri told news agency AFP.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Afghan foreign ministry, however, remained evasive about whether it would dispatch a delegation to the conference, which will focus on kickstarting peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are still negotiating with the Russian officials," spokesman Sebaghtullah Ahmadi said. "We welcome any peace effort that is Afghan-led."</seg>
<seg id="8">Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the militant group was still considering whether to go.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moscow has also invited representatives from the United States as well as India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet republics in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pakistan, which has long been accused of providing support to the Afghan Taliban, would "definitely attendâ, foreign ministry spokesman Muhammad Faisal told AFP.</seg>
<seg id="11">The US embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Moscow meeting was initially scheduled to take place in September, but was postponed after Kabul insisted that the process should be Afghan-led.</seg>
<seg id="13">The meeting comes at a sensitive time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Newly appointed US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been trying to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate an end to the war, and there are fears the Russian multi-lateral meeting could derail those efforts.</seg>
<seg id="15">A US government watchdog said last week that Kabul government's control of Afghanistan had slipped in recent months.</seg>

<seg id="2">North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, both hoping to get out from under U.S. economic sanctions, have agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations, North Koreaâs state media reported Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">M. Diaz-Canel, who is in Asia on his first international tour since assuming office in April, arrived in Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was met at the airport by Kim Jong Un, who joined him on the ride into the city past cheering crowds.</seg>
<seg id="5">North Koreaâs state media reported that the leaders held negotiations at the Paekhwawon State Guest House, stressed their shared socialist history and vowed continued solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The official media did not offer many details, but said the talks proceeded in a friendly atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting with Kim Jong Un could be seen as a warning for Washington, which has been experiencing an increasing difficulty in its efforts to ensure significant progress on North Koreaâs denuclearization issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pyongyang, which has also been quietly cozying up to Moscow recently, has been hardening its rhetoric before the meeting in New York later this week between the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea main negotiator, Kim Yong Chol.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the weekend, Pyongyang used its official media to criticize the US for its continued sanctions - a political tool also extensively used by Washington on Cuba and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">North Korea hinted it may resume nuclear development if Washington doesnât change is tune.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sanctions has been an important issue on M.Diaz-Canelâs agenda.</seg>
<seg id="12">During his visit in Moscow last week, M.Diaz-Canel discussed a nearly 50 million dollar (43,8 million euro) arms deal with Russia, and won a similar vow of expanded political, economic and military ties from Vladimir Putin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The two presidents then issued a joint statement denouncing U.S. âinterference into domestic affairs of sovereign nations.â</seg>
<seg id="14">The U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, initially imposed in 1958 and subsequently expanded, has remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="15">Russia faced a dire U.S. and EU sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="16">M. Diaz-Canel is to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="17">He will visit China, Vietnam and Laos.</seg>

<seg id="2">The group of the most prominent national artists appearing in the new rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is expanding.</seg>
<seg id="3">Inga ValinskienÄ joins the team of artists with one of the most important roles - famous woman will play the role of Juliet's nanny.</seg>
<seg id="4">Povilas MeÅ¡kÄla, who will take care of the singing of artists, became an important part of the team.</seg>
<seg id="5">âI think there are many and very beautiful love stories created since Shakespeare's times, but âRomeo and Julietâ will likely remain the symbol of these stories forever, and will be produced on different stages for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="6">It will be interesting to become a part of one of these productionsâ, says I.ValinskienÄ about the new challenge.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although this famous woman is well-known on the stage and has created many roles in various plays or musicals, she has not yet played a nanny.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The time to play Juliet has already passed", smiles I.ValinskienÄ.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the time was right, I would have gladly accepted such a proposal."</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, the character of a nanny in W.Shakespeare's drama is no less important, and some critics even consider it to be the most significant.</seg>
<seg id="11">A nanny is not only a mediator, a helper - her character and the tone of speech, a feminine approach to feelings, and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives the plot more and different colors.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, the nanny is also important because she is one of only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".</seg>
<seg id="13">"The nannyâs character is not very close to my temper and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creating a different character than yourself is a fun part of the creative process.</seg>
<seg id="15">So far, I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation", says I.ValinskienÄ, and she reveals that she would probably had done the same if she was Juliet's nanny.</seg>
<seg id="16">âI think, the nanny listened to her heart.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many women do that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I would probably do the same.â</seg>
<seg id="19">The legendary rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" by KÄstutis AntanÄlis is created according to the famous drama "Romeo and Juliet" by W.Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="20">The production, which is based on real facts, tells the tragic love story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sad outcome of the story is determined by the conflict that has an unclear origin between the families of the young people - the Montague and the Capulet.</seg>
<seg id="22">"At all times, all stories are possible.</seg>
<seg id="23">There have always been and will be parents who are against the choice of the children.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only today solutions to such problems are more diverseâ, replies future nanny I.ValinskienÄ to the question, whether the story of Romeo and Juliet could repeat itself today.</seg>
<seg id="25">For my children, I would agree with many things, also with daughters-in-law."</seg>

<seg id="1">Skamp presents a song whose video has already been turned down by one TV</seg>
<seg id="2">âSkampâ, the band which is celebrating the 20th anniversary, started actively making music again this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Announcing a single anniversary concert "Skamp20" on December 26 in âSiemensâ arena in Vilnius, the famous trio presents new works one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="4">This time it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a brave song video clip.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This song is about love, so I thought that the video should demonstrate all types of relationship, regardless of age or sexual orientation", says Erica Jennings about the idea of a new song and video clip, and she is convinced that any manifestation of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the video of "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" there are more than ten couples of different orientation and age: "We have always supported the LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will not need to discuss it", says Victor Diawara, who created the music at the beginning of the year during family vacation in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, because to this video, âSkampâ have already received negative reactions - one of the country's most popular broadcasters refused it.</seg>
<seg id="8">This tells a lot about our society.</seg>
<seg id="9">TV will not show the video because it shows people kissing and it is supposedly inappropriate content for children.</seg>
<seg id="10">And what about the fact that any time when you turn on the TV you can see fights and other examples of violence on the screen. Is it the right content?", asks E.Jennings rhetorically.</seg>
<seg id="11">Vilius Alesius agrees with Erica: "It would be nice to see more people who are holding hands and kissing, regardless their social status, gender or age.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have children and we want them to grow in an environment with more tolerance and less bullying.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to brighten the day of the audience and make them smile with a new song and video clip.â</seg>
<seg id="14">"Skamp" has been known for courageous song texts since 1998, speaking on unpopular or sensitive topics.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the best songs of the band - old and new - will sound loud and wide at the âSkamp20â concert on December 26 in âSiemensâ arena in Vilnius.</seg>
<seg id="16">Everyone is welcome with their families, and children under 10 years of age can enter free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2">While Seimas considers returning to the deliberations of the commission investigating the activities of LRT, the Presidentâs Office fears that the governing party simply seeks to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians", said Mindaugas LingÄ, the advisor of the President, to "Å½iniÅ³ radijas".</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the advisor emphasized that it is possible to see an opposite process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is possible to see that there is a wish to have more of this (political - ELTA) influence.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, we appraise this rather criticallyâ, said M.LingÄ.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, the proposals of Seimasâ LRT commission are questionable and of doubtful legality, since they are aimed at the independence of the broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, M. LingÄ emphasized, improvement of LRT management is necessary, and this should be done with expert assistance as well as by identifying concrete aspects that interfere with the smooth functioning of LRT.</seg>
<seg id="9">He stressed that international institutions are already emphasizing that the activity of LRT should be supervised not by political, but competent institutions.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the commission investigating the activity of LRT.</seg>
<seg id="11">These conclusions have received a lot of criticism.</seg>
<seg id="12">The proposals to change the management of the LRT were evaluated very skeptically - to reduce the powers of the Council and to relate the terms of office of its members to the terms of office of the appointing authorities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The European Broadcasting Union has considered this and expressed their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">The opposition group of Seimas members appealed to the Constitutional Court in January on whether the special parliamentary commission investigating the activities and finances of LRT is not in conflict with the Constitution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seimas began to consider amendments to the Law on the Declaration of Residence, submitted by RamÅ«nas Karbauskis, Senior Member of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, according to which citizens, who work and pay taxes outside Lithuania, would be exempted from compulsory health insurance tax.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the submission of the draft on Tuesday, it was supported by 56 members of the Seimas, 9 were against, 25 members of the Parliament abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">After consideration in the committees, the draft is scheduled for consideration in the Seimas plenary meeting on December 6. The Seimas also decided to ask for the Government's conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under the proposed project, persons who pay social security contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the countries of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, are exempted from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the decision of the State Social Insurance Fund Administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those who live and work outside Lithuania, according to the data provided and approved by the State Social Insurance Fund Board (âSodraâ) and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered as departed from Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="7">Services not used by a person are considered.</seg>
<seg id="8">âThere are additional opportunities to know the fact that a person is departedâ, R.Karbauskis explained at the Seimas.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Antanas Matulas, Conservative Member of the Seimas, the proposed legal regulation would be unfair for citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.</seg>
<seg id="10">âA part of the Lithuanians living abroad are misusing itâ, A.Matulas remarked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas believes that thus we encourage the citizens to abandon the obligation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his opinion, it would be possible for the cheaters to use the health care system free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the proposed amendments to the law, people, who have departed to live in other countries and pay social insurance contributions there, will not accumulate debts, and it will reduce the burden of administration of âSodraâ debt.</seg>
<seg id="14">At present, Lithuanian citizens, who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared the departure in the Register of the Citizens according to the procedure established by legal acts, have to pay compulsory health insurance (CHI) contributions each month, and if they do not pay, the debt is accumulated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Vilnius Regional Court upheld the verdict for an attempt to commit fraud for the former prominent sportsman Alvydas DuonÄla, but he was acquitted of forgery of documents.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court verdict, announced on Monday, became effective immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">A.DuonÄla was sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years, postponing the enforcement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="5">The multiple Lithuanian champion of kayaking and rowing was sentenced by the Vilnius City District Court in March this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Vilnius District Court, having examined the case in accordance with the appeal, withdrew one charge, but the sentence remained the same.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former athlete will also have to pay nearly 760 euros to the Crime Victims Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Prosecutorâs Office accused A.DuonÄla of having falsified a bill in 2013 regarding a loan of 200,000 litas (about 58,000 euros) to the dentist's office âDalecijaâ managed by his former wife Dalia BurokaitÄ.</seg>
<seg id="10">The spouse learned about this only in December 2016 when she received calls to pay her debt.</seg>
<seg id="11">The former spouse said she had never borrowed money from her husband for the clinic and did not sign the bill.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the judges of Vilnius District Court, there are no objective data in the case proving that it was A.DuonÄla who had entered data that did not correspond to reality that, allegedly, UAB âDalecijaâ owes A.DuonÄla 200 thousand litas.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is agreed with the arguments set out in the complaint of the sentenced person and his counsel, that there is no objective evidence of this in the case.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, having established that A.DuonÄla only used a forged document for deception and having recognized that this attribute - the use of a forged document - is an integral part of the fraud (in this case, the fraud attempt), A.DuonÄla was acquitted in accordance with Paragraph 300 (1) of the Criminal Code, without proving that he participated in a criminal offenseâ, says the verdict of the Vilnius District Court.</seg>

<seg id="1">Antonin Scalia 'wouldn't be terribly surprised' by 'Mad Libs protesting' on Kavanaugh, son says</seg>
<seg id="2">The son of late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father wouldn't have been shocked by the partisan conflagration surrounding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, owing to what he called the improperly outsized power of the Supreme Court in modern life.</seg>
<seg id="3">"On a general level, he wouldn't be terribly surprised about the intensity surrounding this Supreme Court nomination, because so much of it comes down to Roe v. Wade -- at least, that's how the left is presenting it," Christopher Scalia said, referring to the landmark 1973 case holding that women have a constitutional right to an abortion within certain trimesters.</seg>
<seg id="4">In one fell swoop, Roe effectively prevented states from deciding on their own how to regulate abortion, and several states immediately took steps to try to restrict abortion rights in response.</seg>
<seg id="5">"My father often said, with Roe v. Wade in particular but other cases as well, the court was really trying to come in and settle a cultural issue that should have been resolved in elections, and the legislative process," he added during his appearance on "Fox & Friends."</seg>
<seg id="6">"By trying to short-circuit that process, the Supreme Court caused more damage and, as a result, Supreme Court nominations and confirmation battles have become more heated, because justices have taken on the role that properly belongs to legislators."</seg>
<seg id="7">Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse made a similar point during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings earlier this month, when he reiterated that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies and improperly leaves the resulting bureaucratic uncertainties to the Supreme Court to resolve -- effectively making the justices supplemental legislators doing a job abdicated by senators.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of protesters were arrested and charged by Capitol Hill police for improperly interfering with those confirmation proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="9">Asked whether Kavanaugh had any chance of avoiding that kind of backlash -- which now centers primarily on uncorroborated allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct decades ago -- Scalia said there was likely no avoiding the uproar.</seg>
<seg id="10">Responding to claims that Kavanaugh shouldn't serve on the Supreme Court because of his fiery and, at times, defiant behavior during questioning about the lurid allegations against him by senators on Thursday, Scalia suggested justices don't always have calm temperaments.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's really not all that rare for justices to get angry," Scalia said, referencing sometimes-heated dissents in hot-button cases.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's true that judge Kavanaugh was perhaps more aggressive, but that's because the circumstances were a lot different.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was defending his good name from uncorroborated accusations."</seg>
<seg id="14">Kavanaugh on Thursday received the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by a party-line 11-10 vote, to advance to a full Senate floor vote.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a dramatic moment, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he would provide his crucial swing vote in favor of Kavanaugh only if the FBI were given a one-week period in which to investigate current and credible misconduct claims against Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="16">That investigation is ongoing, and President Trump has said the agency has broad authority in the probe to interview "whoever" it wants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fantastical frocks rule in off-the-peg Schiaparelli range</seg>
<seg id="2">Can you make surrealism real?</seg>
<seg id="3">That is the question for the house of Schiaparelli.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Paris couture house founded by Elsa Schiaparelli almost a century ago has launched its first collection of ready-to-wear clothes and handbags.</seg>
<seg id="5">For a label that has always celebrated the fantastical rather than the wearable, it is a concept almost as far fetched as Elsa Schiaparelli's famous hat in the shape of an upturned shoe.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet despite its long history of eccentricity, there is something very modern about this fashion house.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aesthetic is emoji-like, all lobsters, hearts and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Schiaparelli designed the first jumpsuit, in 1930, and was the first designer to set a catwalk show to music.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was Schiaparelli and her friend Salvador DalÃ­ who invented the art-fashion collaboration, as currently espoused at Calvin Klein and Raf Simons with US artist Sterling Ruby.</seg>
<seg id="10">Legend has it that Dali wanted the lobster-embroidered evening gown he and Schiaparelli created to be displayed in the salon with a dressing of real mayonnaise, but he was overruled.</seg>
<seg id="11">Black strapless dress with Man Ray ElectricitÃ© design across the bustier.</seg>
<seg id="12">Photograph: Schiaparelli</seg>
<seg id="13">"We wanted to revisit this idea of collaboration, which is such a part of Schiaparelli history" said Bertrand Guyon, creative director for the past three years, speaking at the house's salon in Place VendÃ´me.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the ready-to-wear collection, he took as a starting point Schiaparelli's friendship with Man Ray and created clothes based on iconic artworks, in partnership with the Man Ray Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Glass Tears, the artist's famous close up of a pair of eyes, appears on a white T-shirt studded with Perspex teardrops, while the floating red lips from Observatory Time: The Lovers appear on a collaged, silk-screen shift dress.</seg>
<seg id="16">Man Ray's Glass Tears appears on a T-shirt from the collection.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of Elsa's quirks was a superstitious devotion to the letter S. Shocking pink, her signature colour, inspired her perfume, Shocking.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Schiaparelli handbag, designed by Guyon with a keyhole design on the clasp, is called Secret.</seg>
<seg id="19">It will retail at the fantastical price of Â£5,000.</seg>
<seg id="20">The surreal side of Paris fashion week was also on display yesterday at a pop-up shop in a warehouse on the left bank of the Seine, selling â¬100 rugs from Virgil Abloh's soon-to-be released collection for Ikea.</seg>
<seg id="21">Half an hour before the opening time, a 500-strong queue of Abloh's young fans stretched along the quai, excited by the prospect of buying one of his designs without the price tags that come with his Louis Vuitton menswear.</seg>
<seg id="22">For Abloh, the project keeps communication channels open with a broader audience than can afford luxury fashion or designer furniture.</seg>
<seg id="23">"No one owns anything any more, but if you have knowledge of a certain chair, then it is part of your dinner conversation.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is the millennials" train of thought," he said recently.</seg>
<seg id="25">By the time models began zooming past the audience on skateboards in a garage in the Marais, it was clear that this was not a day for ordinary catwalk shows.</seg>
<seg id="26">Andreas Kronthaler, Vivienne Westwood's husband and a designer in his own right, took Jessica Fulford-Dobson's portraits of female skateboarders in Kabul as a starting point for a collection that saw men and women in colourful loose robes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some women - and a few men - skated in heeled mule sandals, although those in vertiginous platform boots stayed on foot.</seg>
<seg id="28">Westwood, who watched from the front row in a horse-print dress from the collection and an orange cardigan tied around her waist, joined her husband on the catwalk for his final bow, where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Royal College of Nursing members angry with their union's handling of changes to the NHS pay deal have voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the organisation in a unprecedented move amid accusations it had misrepresented expected pay increases.</seg>
<seg id="3">It came after a protracted saga within the RCN after its former general secretary Janet Davies admitted it had wrongly told members they would all be in line for an immediate 3% pay increase this year following the end of the 1% pay cap.</seg>
<seg id="4">Members were frustrated after many did not receive expected rises in pay, forcing Davies to step down amid pressure from members, which led to the no-confidence vote in the college's council at an emergency general meeting in Birmingham on Friday following a petition.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has cleared the air and the college will emerge stronger as a result," the RCN chair, Maria Trewern, said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This vote is clear and the council and management of the RCN have received the message.</seg>
<seg id="7">Council has already driven change within the organisation in recent weeks - to listen more closely to members and involve them thoroughly - and this will continue."</seg>
<seg id="8">A meeting will take place next week and it is expected that members of the RCN council will step down.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nursing is based on trust," an NHS nurse told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The actions of the RCN council have destroyed the trust that we had in them and they must go.</seg>
<seg id="11">I hope they will do the honourable thing and comply with request.</seg>
<seg id="12">I await with interest to see if the members of other unions seek the same redress."</seg>
<seg id="13">Rachel Harrison, the GMB national officer for the NHS, told the Guardian in August: "Up and down the country, NHS staff have opened their pay cheques and realised it's not the pay rise they thought they were going to get.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they are angry."</seg>
<seg id="15">Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the RCN conceded that it made a number of mistakes in its processes around the 2018 pay deal and its communication.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it stated that the RCN's "Scrap the Cap" campaign forced the government to end the pay cap with a phased pay rise worth 6.5% now set to be introduced over three years.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vote came after an independent report found that the RCN's presentation of the deal was biased towards its acceptance, while Davies was accused of "closing down" scrutiny of the deal.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is claimed that the RCN presented "factually incorrect" information, meaning that members were not able to make an informed judgment on the deal, while alternative options were not explored.</seg>
<seg id="19">The RCN published contradictory information on whether the 3% rise would apply for all members.</seg>
<seg id="20">In a separate briefing before the RCN's congress, representatives were incorrectly told there would be a "3% increase, plus an increase from incremental reform."</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the 3% increase included the incremental rises and, in any case, only certain workers at the top of their pay band would receive that rise immediately.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The majority of information conveyed to members about the implementation of the deal after congress was inaccurate (probably a result of an attempt to simplify the message)," a spokesperson from the Electoral Reform Services, who conducted the report, said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"ERS believes that failure to inform decision makers of information that compared the current system with the proposed deal in a clear succinct manner, hindered informed balanced judgment as it failed to provide clear context to the headline gains, including the 6.5% and 29% figures used in during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="24">The motion of no confidence passed with 78% in favour on a turnout of 3.74% of RCN members.</seg>

<seg id="8">Is a lifelong relationship with debt simply the new normal - not just for younger adults, but for the entire population?</seg>
<seg id="9">Take cars, for example - often the biggest purchase we'll make after buying (if we're lucky) a home.</seg>
<seg id="10">This week, Auto Trader predicted that within a decade all new cars will be bought on finance as the way we expect to pay for our motoring changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jeannie Boyle, director and chartered financial planner at EQ Investors, certainly believes there has been a shift in expectation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Debt is definitely more normal now - credit cards are more prevalent, and so are zero per cent balance transfers, student loans and pay day lenders," she says.</seg>
<seg id="13">"For our grandparents' generation it was shameful to be in debt."</seg>
<seg id="14">In recent times, student debt and house prices have normalised debt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, agrees and says the result could be worrying.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If you're having to borrow four to five times your income to buy a property, an enormous sum in itself, adding some more debt to that may not seem like such a big deal," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">And that is where people are going to get into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="18">Interest rates have been very low for many years and people with big mortgages or other debts should be aware that they need to factor in a cushion for when rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps understandably, commentators from the finance industry seem confident.</seg>
<seg id="20">Brian Brodie, chief executive of the loans agency Freedom Finance, says: "Debt isn't a dirty word."</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether financing home improvements or purchasing a new car, taking out a loan is no longer seen as the "last resort."</seg>
<seg id="22">Low interest rates have driven many people to lock their savings away in fixed-term accounts that offer higher returns, but reduced access to savings.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a result, "middle class" borrowing is on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the last six months, around half of our new loans were taken out by customers with an "excellent" credit rating.</seg>
<seg id="25">For Richard Haymes, head of financial difficulties at Equifax company TDX Group, this expectation of a lifetime of debt is a clear concern.</seg>
<seg id="26">He says: "With inflation hitting a six-month high in August (2.7 per cent), a recent interest rate rise and limited wage growth, it's disconcerting that a large proportion of people are taking on debt without a realistic expectation of being able to pay it back."</seg>
<seg id="27">According to our analysis, personal insolvencies are set to grow by 17 per cent this year, and the main contributing factor is record levels of consumer borrowing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Debt might be manageable while people work and earn but there's concern about what a lifetime in debt might mean for our old-age wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Research carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with equity release specialist More 2 Life shows that unsecured debt among 55- to 74-year-olds has risen by more than a third over the last four years, more than twice as fast as the national average.</seg>
<seg id="30">And the most common form of debt for this age group is credit cards, with 30 per cent spending more than they pay off each month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Boyle adds: "We're increasingly seeing people using pension freedoms to pay off debt when they turn 55, which has an impact on their wellbeing in retirement.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is often the only savings they've effectively been "forced" to make.</seg>
<seg id="33">People also think they will use equity in their property to pay it off later - but this is problematic as downsizing does not always release as much money as expected.</seg>
<seg id="34">Any future drop in property process will exacerbate this.</seg>

<seg id="2">Serena Williams has released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" while covering her bare chest with her hands.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tennis pro shared the clip on her Instagram page, explaining that she created the video to encourage women to self-check their breasts.</seg>
<seg id="4">"This Breast Cancer Awareness Month I've recorded a version of The Divinyls global hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to self-check regularly," Williams wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it's an issue that affects all women of all colours, all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Early detection is key - it saves so many lives.</seg>
<seg id="7">I just hope this helps to remind women of that."</seg>
<seg id="8">Williams continued: "The music video is part of the "I Touch Myself Project" which was created in honour of celebrated diva, Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer, and who gave us her hit song to remind women to put their health first."</seg>
<seg id="9">The project, which is supported by lingerie brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), first launched in 2014 following the passing of Amphlett at the age of 53.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since posting the video on her Instagram account, it has been viewed more than 1.5 million times with legions of fans praising the tennis superstar for performing the song.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So much love for this and what you did, putting yourself out there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thank you Serena," one person wrote.</seg>
<seg id="13">Another added: "I LOVE this, Serena.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm a breast cancer survivor of 20 years and I found the lump myself on self-exam even after mammograms showed nothing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Exams are so so important.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thank you for putting yourself out of your comfort zone - you are a goddess!"</seg>
<seg id="17">As part of the "I Touch Myself Project," Berlei is also releasing a new snakeskin print, rock star inspired bra called The Chrissy.</seg>
<seg id="18">100 per cent of the profits from the bra will be donated to BCNA.</seg>
<seg id="19">When self-checking, it is important to know the signs and symptoms you should be looking for.</seg>
<seg id="20">As well as lumps, other signs of breast cancer include a change in breast size or shape, a rash or skin sores, nipple discharge, skin indentation, constant pain or a change in skin texture.</seg>
<seg id="21">Similarly, swelling around the armpit or collarbone could be an indicator, as can a growing vein or inverted nipple.</seg>
<seg id="22">Women are advised to check their breasts each month.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you notice any symptoms of breast cancer, the NHS advises that you see your GP as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">After examination, your GP will then refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic if they feel your symptoms need further assessment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Driver is so good in this SNL skit that the cast can't keep a straight face</seg>
<seg id="2">Adam Driver was the guest host of Saturday Night Live this week, and he really gave 110%.</seg>
<seg id="3">The show's funniest sketches always tend to be the ones that aren't pegged to a specific current event, and so was the case with new skit "Career Day."</seg>
<seg id="4">It centres on a "bring your father to work" day at an American high school, where teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees to let his elderly oil baron father, Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), give a talk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hobbling in on a cane, Parnassus proceeds to deliver a blistering account of his domination of the oil industry, a megalomaniac likely inspired in part by the Daniel Day-Lewis "There Will Be Blood" character Daniel Plainview.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I was born seven months too early," Parnassus tells the students.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Incubation technology was still in its infancy, so they placed me in a cast iron pot inside a pizza oven until I was ripe enough to walk.</seg>
<seg id="8">My bones never hardened but my spirit did.</seg>
<seg id="9">Be strong and crush your enemies!"</seg>
<seg id="10">Davidson, along with fellow SNL cast member Aidy Bryant who plays the schoolteacher, struggle to keep straight faces and are largely unable to look Driver in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Star Wars actor is in full force however, growing increasingly belligerent as he recalls his personal war with oil baron rival HR Pickins.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I married your granddaughter!" he spits.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Filled her belly with my festering seed and soiled your boy, he is my final revenge HR!"</seg>
<seg id="14">In under five minutes, Parnassus became as enthralling an Adam Driver character as Kylo Ren did in two feature films.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Curse you, HR!"</seg>

<seg id="3">Eight never-before-heard tracks hit the internet overnight on Saturday, featuring guest verses from SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is unclear where they stem from, and neither the nickname the collection is being circulated under, "Bad Kid Chill City EP," nor the artwork (which seems to have been created by a fan) are official.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tracks, which may be demos and only half-finished, sound as though they were recorded during different parts of Lamar's career.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Gang Member" would seem to be of Good Kid Maad City era, while "Heroin" featuring SZA sounds closer to DAMN./Black Panther soundtrack.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tracks being passed around as a collection are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="1">Turmoil for the musical âChicagoâ: after no tickets are left in KlaipÄda, people are invited to go to Vilnius or Kaunas</seg>
<seg id="2">The desire of Lithuanians to see the musical of the KlaipÄda State Musical Theater "Chicago" does not subside.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because of this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musical of all times is set to go on one more tour to the countryâs largest arenas.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, with roughly 1.5 month left to the shows, there is a lack of seats in the arenas.</seg>
<seg id="5">The organizers announce that they have already sold all tickets to the musical in "Å vyturys" arena in KlaipÄda, and that the tickets to âÅ½algirisâ arena in Kaunas and âSiemensâ arena in Vilnius are quickly disappearing.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are no more tickets in the port city, so everyone who wants to see the musical that does not leave anyone indifferent is invited to visit Kaunas or Vilnius where there are still some tickets left.</seg>
<seg id="7">The shows will take place in December, so those who will come from further, will not only see our musical, but also will have a great opportunity to see Christmas trees in the largest cities of the country", said Laima VilimienÄ, head of KlaipÄda State Theater, offering a solution to the fans of the musical.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cast of âChicagoâ will be a little different in December.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the main roles of the musical was entrusted to the actor Tomas Å½aibas for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In âChicagoâ, the talented actor, who is well known from TV screens, will impersonate an inimitable Billy Flynn, the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, who is changing fates of people without any scruples.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the KlaipÄda State Musical Theaterâs musical âChicagoâ has been adapted for larger spaces, arenas, the cast is also larger than in the Broadway show.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Lithuanian âChicagoâ cast consists of almost fifty artists.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main roles of women are entrusted to the spectacular soloist of KlaipÄda State Musical Theater Beata IgnataviÄiÅ«tÄ (killer Velma Kelly) and Gabriele BielskytÄ (killer Roxie Hart), the charismatic soloist of the Kaunas Musical Theater.</seg>
<seg id="14">The âChicagoâ musical depicts the Chicago criminal world of the 1920s, which turns the walls of the prison into a place where the stars are born.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a musical satire of criminal justice, telling about two killers who seek attention and recognition.</seg>
<seg id="16">The musical is full of sexuality and irony.</seg>
<seg id="17">It does not matter where the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - are or what they do, the meaning of their life is to shine like a star.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their life is living for a message on the first page, for a headline, the glitter, the alley of glory...</seg>
<seg id="19">On December 13 âChicagoâ will be shown in âÅ vyturysâ Arena in KlaipÄda, on December 18 - in âÅ½algirisâ arena in Kaunas, on December 20 - in âSiemensâ arena in Vilnius.</seg>

<seg id="1">Living room furniture in Kaunas</seg>
<seg id="2">The living room can be called a representative home zone, where we spend time with friends, invite guests, and so on. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or the house, but also for the guests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The furniture should be selected depending on the size of the living room, the walls, ceiling decor, taste of the owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">The living room should be not only beautiful, but also comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is best to hire an interior designer, who will help to fill the space optimally, so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is advisable to first choose the main point of the living room, i.e. the item with which you will combine furniture, other details.</seg>
<seg id="7">It can be a fireplace or other important accent of the living room.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would also be great to create a space for chatting in the living room, where guests could communicate comfortably without being interfered by the furniture and similar items.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests could sit down and chat.</seg>
<seg id="10">So the layout of the furniture should encourage communication, unite people, rather than distance them from each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Do not push the furniture to the wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The distance from the walls depends on the size of the room.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even if the room is small, leave at least some space away from the wall, do not push the furniture up to it.</seg>
<seg id="14">If the room is spacious, leave even more space from the walls.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the bigger the distance the better.</seg>
<seg id="16">Create balance while arranging the furniture</seg>
<seg id="17">Consider the size and location of various details that will be in your living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">All elements must match with each other.</seg>
<seg id="19">The furniture of the living room must be in line with the interior details.</seg>
<seg id="20">A little contrast is possible.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will brighten up the interior of the living room, but it should not be too big, as the interior will become tacky.</seg>
<seg id="22">We advise you to always consult with interior designers.</seg>
<seg id="23">When creating the interior for the living room yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk to go to the extremes: either you will create a boring interior because you will be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, choose wrongly, or you will overdo while improvising.</seg>
<seg id="24">Proper lighting</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a very important thing.</seg>
<seg id="26">After all, different light reveals space in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="27">The lighting must be arranged at various levels: ceiling chandeliers, wall lamps, floor lamps.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Prosecutor's Office appealed the acquittal of the LBF leaders</seg>
<seg id="2">The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office appealed against the verdict of the Vilnius District Court to the former leaders of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LBF).</seg>
<seg id="3">As the Prosecutor's Office reported on Monday, the complaint states that PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality had no legal basis to contribute with the municipal budget monetary funds to the reconstruction of the private hotel in PanevÄÅ¾ys.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the preliminary investigation, it was determined that in order to find the opportunity to finance reconstruction of the hotel, a contract for purchase and sale of public services was concluded between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5">Prosecutors say that the services, which federation was supposed to provide to PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality in accordance with the said agreement, were not intended to and could not be provided, since the funding from the state and sponsors was already received or intended to be provided to the planned services, and a part of the planned events had already taken place before the contract was signed and already paid from other funds, and some of the events have already taken place after VAT invoicing - money according with the invoices have been transferred for the events that have not yet taken place.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office argues that it disagrees with the conclusion of the court of the first instance that the State itself has instructed PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality to start reconstruction of the private hotel, because there was no state obligation for a particular hotel, there was only an offer to PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality to solve the development issues of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the opinion of the Prosecutor's Office, the court unreasonably stated that the heads of the LBF and PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality attempted to fulfill the state obligation without having legitimate ways, since the data in the case showed that there was a possibility to organize European Basketball Championship group matches in other cities, without violating the law.</seg>
<seg id="8">Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office appeal for the annulment of the exculpatory verdict of the first instance court and adoption of a new judgment - a conviction - in this case for seven natural persons and one legal person.</seg>
<seg id="9">On October 15, Vilnius District Court fully acquitted LBF General Secretary Mindaugas BalÄiÅ«nas for all alleged crimes.</seg>
<seg id="10">This case concerns the preparation for the European Men's Basketball Championship in Lithuania in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">M. BalÄiÅ«nas was accused of abuse of power, fraud and other crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Prosecutor's Office accused M.BalÄiÅ«nas that while he was a General Secretary of LBF, he agreed with the Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Director of the Federation to prepare on behalf of the Federation work delivery and acceptance certificates that were not in line with reality as well as other false financial documents and accounts for alleged services that LBF provided to PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality that were entered into official accounts.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the data of the preliminary investigation conducted by the officials of PanevÄÅ¾ys Board of the Special Investigation Service (SIS), the funds of PanevÄÅ¾ys City Municipality could have been overtaken by fraud and using false documents for the benefit of the LBF and later used by the company âVia Unicaâ for the reconstruction of the hotel âRomanticâ.</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of this hotel, Dalia KuklierienÄ, was accused of bribing - it is suspected that she gave a television set as a bribe to M.BalÄiÅ«nas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Everyone who has been convicted with M.BalÄiÅ«nas have been acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="16">The accusations in this case were filed against eight natural persons and one legal entity, the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Remote workplace is compared to the Bermuda Triangle</seg>
<seg id="2">Since 1992, the number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania has already exceeded the total population of Alytus city and amounts to about 83 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="3">If the requirements for a particular physical workplace and its safety are clear, then the choice to work remotely - from home, public space or even other countries - is becoming a new Bermuda Triangle.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Occupational Safety and Health sets out safety and health conditions for remotely working employees that are not different from the conditions of other employees of the company, the variety of modern forms of work may raise a number of issues, says the press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the event of an accident at home, the employer pays a compensation which is 80% of the salary for the first two days of unemployment, and for the remainder of the period it is paid by âSodraâ.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it is determined that the accident happened during work, then âSodraâ compensates 100% of the salary from the first day of sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="7">When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labor Inspectorate and damages administered by BTA, it is obvious that the absolute majority of occupational accidents and various injuries occur at workplace.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most often it is various physical work, where the risk of injury is higher: careless handling of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the offices with the most marketable and best paid specialists face their own challenges, which are caused by the freedom of mobility provided by the employer that employees are very fond ofâ, says Jevgenija KrikÅ¡ÄiÅ«nÄ, Head of Human Resources Management Department of BTA.</seg>
<seg id="10">Legislation that is in force in Lithuania recommends clearly regulating the duties and responsibilities of an employee, defining working time, place and functions, and this also applies to the remote working.</seg>
<seg id="11">If this is done, it's easier to determine whether an accident occurred during working time, or not.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are different situations and nuances, and each case is considered individually.</seg>
<seg id="13">Employees often hear that, for example, the employer is responsible for the accidents that occur on the way to or from work, or while travelling to work meetings.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, there are plenty of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate talks, to be as clear as possible, and to find out for the benefit of both sides, what situations are actually treated as accidents at work and which will fall under the status of domestic traumasâ, advises the specialist.</seg>
<seg id="15">J. KrikÅ¡ÄiÅ«nÄ argues that in these days, when work functions can be performed with a computer, a mobile phone and a stable Internet connection, an employee will not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="16">Employees are mobile, and instead of home they can choose to work while drinking coffee at a cafe or in a park while enjoying the sun.</seg>
<seg id="17">Will it be a workplace or not?</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the discussed working hours do not match the ones provided in the agreement?</seg>
<seg id="19">There may be really ambiguous situations, the circumstances of which are clarified by the investigation initiated by âSodraâ or the State Labor Inspectorateâ, says the specialist.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to her, from the financial point of view, the main difference between an incident at work and at home is the amount of sickness benefit.</seg>
<seg id="21">J. KrikÅ¡ÄiÅ«nÄ acknowledges that she had unofficially heard unpleasant experiences when employers try to conceal the real circumstances of accidents or traumas and try to persuade employees to seek medical help outside the working hours, to assume responsibility for themselves, thereby, to suffer financially.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is a dishonest, disrespectful attitude towards the employee, and should not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="23">On the other hand, the already mentioned mobility of people encourages to search for additional tools that can help companies in similar situations: it also includes employerâs civil liability insurance for damage to employees, accident insurance against trauma, acquiring insurance for disability or even death, and health insurance is also importantâ, says J.KrikÅ¡ÄiÅ«nÄ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Lithuanian rugby team, which has made its debut in the European âTrophyâ division, is still struggling to keep up with its stronger rivals.</seg>
<seg id="3">In terms of capacity, the âTrophyâ division is the third strongest division in the old continent after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="4">It includes 13 to 18 ranked continental teams.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lithuanians started the match in October with a steady victory in Å iauliai 30:10 against the Czech team.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last weekend Lithuanian team went to Lodz, where they could not keep up with the Polish team - 0:33 (0:12).</seg>
<seg id="7">Though the Lithuanians defended themselves selflessly, they often violated the rules, and the Polish rugby players advanced due to penalty strikes.</seg>
<seg id="8">At 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes, penalty strikes were made by Wojciech Piotrowicz, who delivered 12 point advantage to his teammates.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the first half, Lithuanians had to play 10 minutes without Tautvydas MaÅ¾ylis, who received a yellow card.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the second half of the game, the guests made several attacks, but they completed them without results.</seg>
<seg id="11">At that time, the Poles managed to break our defense.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mateusz Plichta, and afterwards Krystian Pogorzelski and Mateusz Adamski, scored in the playing field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The coach of the Lithuanian national team, which played without several important rugby players, Ntando Manyosha from SAR, recognized the rivalsâ advantage and said that such match provided a very valuable experience.</seg>
<seg id="14">âThe Poles played very well and dominated all the components of the game.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our goal was to withstand this match for as long as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">We have just moved to this higher level and have to settle in it.</seg>
<seg id="17">We won the first match against the Czechs, but then we met with very powerful rivals and had to admit their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Polish team gave us useful lessonsâ, said a specialist from SAR, who has been standing in front of the Lithuanian national team for four years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The next match in the âTrophyâ division will be played by Lithuanians on April 6, 2019 at home with the Portuguese or the Romanians.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dutch and Swiss teams also compete in this division.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Japanese Coast Guard is actively looking for the missing island</seg>
<seg id="2">Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to a very small island in the north of Japan in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">Small, meaningless and worthless island, which was essentially unsuitable for living, was very important to Japan.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so important that after its disappearance the area now is being actively explored - maybe it will still appear?</seg>
<seg id="5">Why does Japan need this island so much?</seg>
<seg id="6">It will not appear.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is likely that ice and underwater landslides have taken this island forever, although not long ago it was almost two meters above the surface of the water.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is almost no doubt that the island simply broke, but at least its traces are expected to be found.</seg>
<seg id="9">When did the island disappear, nobody knows exactly - it was so worthless that nobody really followed it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Probably the first to find out the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima were the Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an auxiliary visual navigation tool.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its disappearance, even for these fishermen, is not a tragedy as there are better ways to know where it is allowed to fish, and where the disputed Russian waters begin.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.</seg>
<seg id="13">This narrow strip of land was the most western edge of the Kuril Islands.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a chain of islands, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, while Japan calls it the Northern territories.</seg>
<seg id="15">The conflict with some breaks lasts from the middle of the 19th century, but in the 20th century it intensified in full force.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are natural resources in these areas, however, Japan believes that the islands should belong to it historically.</seg>
<seg id="17">The point is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were the first to make the map, to start a more detailed research, while registering countless small islands.</seg>
<seg id="19">The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin belonged to the latter, and all the Kuril Islands - to Japan.</seg>
<seg id="20">These two countries lived in peace until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan in the war.</seg>
<seg id="21">In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and seized the Kuril Islands.</seg>
<seg id="22">Japan, by the way, does not make big claims regarding the entire archipelago, although they were there first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai.</seg>
<seg id="23">Japan feels that it has a historic right, since they were the first ones to explore the islands, and they belonged to Japan under the agreements signed in 1855.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, Japan offered to Russia to share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider adopting such an offer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now that the island is missing, this geographic link is lost.</seg>
<seg id="26">The physical marker of the presence of Japan in those waters had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a big loss, which is why the remains of the island are being sought.</seg>
<seg id="28">But even after finding them, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not fit a simple definition of an island - it must be a land.</seg>
<seg id="29">This indicates a slight decrease in the territory of Japan and a great shrink in the exclusive economic zone, calculated from the shores.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is interesting, what the island's search mission is hoping for - it is certainly not simply lost or drifted.</seg>

<seg id="2">We had to wait for the final verdict of the judges for more than a week to find out who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Poland, nine Polish and Lithuanian matches were organized.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lithuanians and Polish won four matches each.</seg>
<seg id="5">The outcome of the crucial battle was a long debate of the panel of judges and the final decision of the secretariat of the match.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting of the teams began with the victories of the Lithuanian boxers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius VyÅ¡niauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) defeated Jakub Surma 3:0, soon Edgaras Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after the persistent fight defeated Radomir Obrusniak 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was followed by two victories of the hosts: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) defeated Mantas DuÅ¾inas 3:0, and Filip Wachala (up to 69 kg) excelled Saimonas Banys 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="9">Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) has returned the advantage to the Lithuanian team.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Lithuanian defeated Bartosz Golebiewski 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the next fight, Piotr Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) defeated Eigirdas KasmoÄius in the third round and the result was equal again 3:3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results of brothers Jokuliai were different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Robertas Jokulys (up to 91 kg) defeated Andrzej Kolton 3:0, and Arvydas Jokulis (over 91 kg) had to acknowledge Adam Kulik's advantage already in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The biggest controversy was caused by Tadas TamaÅ¡auskas (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski's fight.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was the reason why it took more than a week to reach the final result of the cross-border meeting.</seg>
<seg id="16">One judge recognized the victory of the Polish, two judges - of the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error the point of one judge that was intended for the Lithuanian was credited to Soczynski.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the long dispute it was decided the winner was Polish boxer - 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="18">The hosts won 10:8 in the meeting of the Lithuanian-Polish teams (2 points are awarded for the victory).</seg>
<seg id="19">They succeeded to revenge Lithuanians for the devastating defeat they suffered during the last match.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2015, Lithuanian boxers won five of the six fights with a result 10:2 in the meeting that took place in MarijampolÄ.</seg>
<seg id="21">The meeting of the Lithuanian team leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian Boxing Championship that will take place on November 14-17, in Å ilutÄ.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the country's championship, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the honor of the country at the next year's World and European Championships.</seg>

<seg id="1">How does a dog determine the direction of human tracks?</seg>
<seg id="2">You already know that the dog's sense of smell is extremely sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="3">They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, and some can even smell diseases.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tracker dogs that became famous in the movies are also well-known, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do they determine, in which direction the trace owner went?</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, this question is much more complicated than you think.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trace following consists of three stages: finding, determining the direction and tracking.</seg>
<seg id="8">The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to decide in which direction the person has went.</seg>
<seg id="9">After all, the time between the different steps is less than one second, so their smell is not very different, right?</seg>
<seg id="10">Not really.</seg>
<seg id="11">A 1990 study published by the University of Oslo describes experiments in which a dog was brought at a 90-degree angle to a human trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tests were performed on grass and on asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in most cases, the dogs easily identified the direction of the human, even when he tried to mislead them by going backwards.</seg>
<seg id="14">Can you imagine how complex this task is?</seg>
<seg id="15">The difference between the smell of adjacent traces is very small, and with time it is decreases even more.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, scientists say it's not that strange - dogs could tell which part of the foot touched the ground first.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is because their sense of smell is an incredible tool.</seg>
<seg id="18">The dog's brain is dominated by the areas responsible for the sense of smell (the way our brain is dominated by the regions responsible for the eyesight).</seg>
<seg id="19">Noses of the dogs have 125-300 million smell receptors.</seg>
<seg id="20">In general, dogsâ sense of smell is at least 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, but their ability to interpret different scents is even more important.</seg>
<seg id="21">Scientists then performed similar experiments with tracks left by bicycles, but it was much more difficult for the dogs to trace their direction.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is due to the fact that bicycleâs tracks are not segmented as human tracks, making it more difficult to isolate different locations for comparison - this is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, dogs are not the owners of the strongest sense of smell.</seg>
<seg id="24">This title is likely to go to the bears.</seg>
<seg id="25">The white bears' males follow females that are ready to mate hundreds of kilometers, while brown bears can smell a dead animal up to 30 km.</seg>

<seg id="5">A.JagelaviÄiÅ«tÄ has more than 170 thousand followers of her Facebook account - she reached that figure using a certain strategy: âAt first you gratify a personâs taste, pull them after yourself, and in the course of time you gradually improve that tasteâ.</seg>
<seg id="6">Stylist A.JagelaviÄiÅ«tÄ claims that she cannot stand fake people, therefore shows her face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way to present oneself are the most important criteria for popularity in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">She observes that the human culture is disappearing in social networks, as many Internet users go there in order to fight with someone or to read the comments of other fighting people: "For example, when I was an adolescent, there was a time when I wanted to fight with everyone and curse - now I do not want that."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Fake life is the most horrible thing.</seg>
<seg id="9">And there are so much of it in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Facebook a bit less than Instagram", she says.</seg>
<seg id="11">A.JagelaviÄiÅ«tÄ, who has a degree in interior design and painting, says that she sends a specific message on social networks - she talks about emancipation of women.</seg>

<seg id="17">It is much better to give people what they want and to give silently something that you want yourselfâ, says A.JagelaviÄiÅ«tÄ.</seg>
<seg id="18">One of the events that do not attract young people easily are classical music concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Famous people suggested to increase their popularity through real life stories: to talk about backstage, failures, life events, while remaining authentic.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is the strategy that A.JageleviÄiÅ«tÄ suggests to apply to the whole culture.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to her, if the culture does not gratify anyone, does not entertain and shows real values, it has no opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="22">âLike a boring lecturer in front of students - are there any chances?</seg>
<seg id="23">If we do not find a way to present that art, you can advertise as much as you want, nothing will happen.</seg>

<seg id="1">'I'm A Victim of Sexual Assault'</seg>
<seg id="2">Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said Sunday morning that she is a victim of sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="3">Conway responded to the intense exchanges during the past week's testimonies from Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response, Conway emotionally declared she herself is a victim of sexual assault in the past and defended Kavanaugh to host Jake Tapper, saying she believes sexual assault accusations against him were "cherry-picked."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.</seg>
<seg id="6">I'm a victim of sexual assault," Conway told CNN's "State of the Union" program Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'm a victim of sexual assault, I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh or Take Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to be held responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">You have to be responsible for your own conduct."</seg>
<seg id="9">Conway blasted the network as a "disgrace" for comparing the accusations made against Kavanaugh to those directed at Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in Pennsylvania state prison last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Conway also railed against the Senate Judiciary Committee's inability to remove former President Bill Clinton from office despite having oral sex in the Oval Office and "lying about it" directly to the American people.</seg>

<seg id="2">Americas are at odds over the testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who claims the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the number of people who believed Ford or Kavanaugh were lying was similar, with 38 percent saying they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while a smaller 30 percent said the same about Ford.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both parties after Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein detailing her allegation against the judge.</seg>
<seg id="5">When the letter was made publi,c both Ford and Kavanaugh said they would be prepared to speak before the committee.</seg>
<seg id="6">During her testimony, Ford said she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was the person who had attempted to assault her at a house party in the early 1980s dismissing the idea that there could be a case of mistaken identity.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an emotional opening statement the 51-year-old said she had felt it was her civic duty to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am terrified," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kavanaugh, who denied the allegations made by Ford, as well as by two other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, said he had "never sexually assaulted anyone - not in high school, not in college, not ever."</seg>
<seg id="11">"There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything - no matter how far-fetched or odious, that will block a vote of my nomination," he said.</seg>

<seg id="13">Unsurprisingly, the results of the YouGov poll, which surveyed 2,607 people from 27-28 September were split on party lines, with Democrats far more likely to believe Ford (73 percent) and Republicans more likely to believe Kavanaugh (74 percent,) although more Republicans believed Ford than Democrats did Kavanaugh (14 percent compared with 11 percent.)</seg>

<seg id="6">I understand now that it's more an appreciation and an expression of love for me to do it," Angelina Whalley told The Observer.</seg>
<seg id="7">She said that her husband has issued strict instructions on what to do with his corpse in a process that takes about a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Muscles, nerves and arteries need to be unwound, the body will be injected with silicone and then put in a pose.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He said to me: "Angelina, you are entitled to freeze me down to -25 Celsius for one year, but after that time you really need to put your hands on me because otherwise I will get freeze burn.""</seg>

<seg id="12">Von Hagens rose to fame in the UK when he performed a live autopsy on British television, the first public autopsy for 170 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">More than 47 million people have visited versions of Body Worlds around the world since 1995.</seg>
<seg id="14">Founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernal, told The Guardian that the 28,000 square foot exhibition space was based on 100% donations from people who "have given consent in order to help and educate the living, to help people see what can go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">We see and read so many horrible things that it makes us scared of death.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lawyers for the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said Friday that they would sue a German magazine after it had published what they called "blatantly illegal" accusations by an American woman who says she was raped by Ronaldo in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of Ronaldo's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the report in the magazine, Der Spiegel, was "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy" and that he would seek legal redress for his client from the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="4">The statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo's agent, the firm Gestifute, in response to a request for comment on Der Spiegel's article, which was published online Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gestifute did not answer any specific questions about the content of Der Spiegel's report, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.</seg>
<seg id="6">Der Spiegel first reported on the allegation in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ronaldo, one of the biggest names in world sports, is a five-time world player of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">He transferred to Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid this summer; the Italian club declined to comment on Der Spiegel's report.</seg>
<seg id="9">The magazine said the suspected rape took place in June 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas, according to Leslie Mark Stovall, the lawyer for the woman who made the accusation, Kathryn Mayorga.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ronaldo and Mayorga then reached an out-of-court settlement, according to Stovall and the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, Mayorga agreed to a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a $375,000 payment from Ronaldo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Stovall did not immediately respond to email requests from Reuters for comment on the article, and Mayorga did not answer telephone calls to her home.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stovall told Der Spiegel, however, that he had filed a civil complaint seeking to declare the nondisclosure agreement void.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayorga told Der Spiegel she no longer felt bound by the agreement as she suffers from the consequences of the night nine years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I've had like these serious breakdowns," she told Der Spiegel.</seg>
<seg id="16">"And again, blaming of the rape.</seg>

<seg id="1">Independence Through Sustainable Author Businesses</seg>
<seg id="2">Are you ready for self-publishing 3.0?</seg>
<seg id="3">In a new white paper released today on #selfpub3.0, the Alliance of Independent Authors details how, for the first time, authors can now join the ranks of other creative entrepreneurs in growing their independence and building sustainable author businesses.</seg>
<seg id="4">Orna Ross, founder of the Alliance of Independent Authors and repeatedly named "One of the 100 Most Influential People in Publishing," will explain why and how authors should embrace self-publishing 3.0 at Digital Book World 2018.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Consumer trends like the rise of personal branding, mindful consumption and mobile phone reading are combining with digital publishing tech to create more favorable conditions than ever before for author-businesses," says Ross.</seg>
<seg id="6">But only authors who have developed an independent, creative and empowered mindset, who understand the value of their intellectual property, can benefit from these opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="7">#selfpub3.0 encourages authors to ensure we have a diversity of earning streams through our own websites, which become the hub of our successful publishing and media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="8">Income streams might include direct sales, subscription models, crowdsourced patronage, wide distribution models and other income streams like online teaching and affiliate income.</seg>
<seg id="9">#selfpub3.0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books as widely as possible, in as many formats as possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mostly, #selfpub3.0 is about the shift in mindset needed to take control of your author business rather than unthinkingly assigning all your intellectual property, your most valuable creative asset, to a business owned by another, whether that is a trade-publisher or self-publishing service.</seg>
<seg id="11">These are the steps that maximize income, impact, and influence for authors and should be of interest to every author and publisher working in the digital age, Ross says, pointing out that true independence, for authors as for anyone, must be rooted in commercial as well as creative independence.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the future, now.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it has never been so bright for independent authors.</seg>
<seg id="14">Self-Publishing 1.0 was desktop publishing and print on demand.</seg>
<seg id="15">Self-Publishing 2.0 was selling e-books for e-readers and phones via online bookstores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now we're entering the era of self-publishing 3.0: self-publishers building viable and sustainable author enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Alliance of Independent Authors is the only global, non-profit association for self-publishing writers.</seg>
<seg id="18">ALLi aims to foster excellence and ethics in self-publishing; to support authors in the making and selling of their books; and to advocate for author independence through the building of sustainable digital businesses.</seg>

<seg id="3">Late on Thursday, the ruling parties - made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - proposed a 2019 deficit that is, at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), three times the previous administration's target.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement rattled markets on Friday, prompting a sell-off of bonds and a rout of banking stocks.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also set up a clash with the European Commission, which monitors and enforces EU fiscal rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">President Sergio Mattarella, addressing a group at the presidential palace that had marked the 70th anniversary of the constitution, noted that the state's founding law requires "balanced budgets and the sustainability of debt."</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is to protect the savings of our fellow citizens," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">A little later at a conference in central Italy, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said the country's debt, the largest among big European Union economies at 131 percent of GDP, must not be allowed to increase.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Italy needs to favor public and private investment and to contain and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to Ansa state news agency.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The debt must be "put on downward path," he added.</seg>
<seg id="11">Matteo Salvini, leader of the League and also a deputy prime minister, responded to Mattarella by saying that years of Brussels-imposed austerity had driven up debt.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Be calm Mr. President," Salvini said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Years of budgets imposed by Europe have made our public debt explode. Finally we are changing course and betting on the future and on growth."</seg>
<seg id="14">Earlier, before either Mattarella or Visco spoke, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the budget would "repay the people for the thieving of the past," though he added the government's intention was not to challenge the EU or financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ruling parties pushed Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is an economist unaffiliated with either group, to sign off on their plans to hike deficit spending.</seg>
<seg id="16">Italian media said Mattarella had supported Tria's failed effort to keep the deficit target below 2 percent of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The president and the central banker have no direct role in making economic policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 77-year-old president can reject a law and send it back to parliament, but he can do so only once.</seg>
<seg id="19">Parliament can then pass it again, unchanged, and he must sign it into law.</seg>

<seg id="1">Indonesia tsunami sensors missed huge waves: official</seg>
<seg id="2">Indonesia's geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning 34 minutes after it was first issued following a major earthquake that sent huge waves crashing into the northeastern coast of Sulawesi island, killing hundreds and leaving thousands more homeless.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ruins of cars as seen after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami, which hit the city of Palu about 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta and further along the coastline, killed at least 384 people.</seg>
<seg id="5">Officials said on Saturday the death toll was likely to rise.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their death.</seg>
<seg id="7">The geophysics agency (BMKG) faced criticism on Saturday on social media, with many questioning if the tsunami warning was lifted too soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to "end" the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have no observation data at Palu.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that," said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami center at BMKG.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in sea level, only recorded an "insignificant," six-centimeter (2.5 inches) wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is something we must evaluate for the future," said Triyono.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was not clear whether the tsunami, which officials say hammered Palu and the surrounding area at extremely high speeds measuring in the hundreds of kilometers per hour, occurred before or after the warning had been lifted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Resident checks dead bodies to find their family at a street after tsunami hit in Palu, Indonesia September 29, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Based on the videos circulating on social media, we estimate the tsunami happened before the warning officially ended," Triyono said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The most devastating came on Boxing Day in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including over 126,000 in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="18">The scenic town of Palu sits at the mouth of a narrow bay in northeastern Sulawesi and is home to around 380,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was hit by a tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB).</seg>
<seg id="20">Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at University of Oxford, said it was "surprising" the quake had generated a tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="21">Friday's quake was recorded as a "strike-slip" event where neighboring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami," he said, adding the narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster agency, told reporters his team had been "preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand" when the tsunami warning was "suddenly ended."</seg>
<seg id="24">The communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Nugroho said the quake had brought down the area's power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast.</seg>
<seg id="25">Indonesians took to social media to question the BMKG's move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="26">"So upset.. the warning was lifted.. although a tsunami happened..." said one Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golf: 'Mollywood' duo on course to smash box office records</seg>
<seg id="2">Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood won their foursomes on Saturday to become the first European duo to sweep all four pairs matches and are on course for even more history as Europe take a 10-6 lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup.</seg>
<seg id="3">After thumping Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau 5&4 they became the first-ever European pairing to win all four of their matches.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins, in 1979, have ever managed it for the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crushing winning margins - 3&1, 5&4, 4&3 and 5&4 - tell only half the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">Left in their dust was a battered Woods, the 14-times major winner being drubbed three times, with Patrick Reed brushed aside twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">The other win came against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the form pairing of the U.S. team this week who won their other three games.</seg>
<seg id="8">Molinari and Fleetwood go into Sunday's singles with the chance to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fleetwood has already claimed the most points in a single Ryder Cup by a European rookie.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dubbed "Mollywood" by their newly-acquired army of fans, at first glance the pair might have looked unlikely contenders to lead the European charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ryder Cup first-timers such as Fleetwood are not supposed to perform like this, while Molinari had failed to win any of his six previous matches, losing four of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, a more positive view was that Fleetwood was European number one last year, knows the Le Golf National course inside out having won the French Open here in 2017, and showed his big-match temperament by finishing second in this year's U.S. Open.</seg>
<seg id="13">Molinari is the freshly-minted British Open champion and widely regarded as the most consistent ball-striker on the European Tour - an attribute that has paid huge dividends on the tight course where finding the rough, as the Americans all-too-often did, was a recipe for disaster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those pedigrees, combined with what looked like a great on-course chemistry, proved an irresistible force.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I feel a little bit emotional now and we're only on Saturday," said the famously laid-back Fleetwood, who has played all weekend with a huge smile on his face.</seg>
<seg id="16">We were really good this afternoon, really solid and played really well.</seg>
<seg id="17">To have your own piece of history together is really special.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm just glad we've done our job for the team."</seg>
<seg id="19">Molinari was equally delighted.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Playing alongside Tommy, it's been amazing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But we've come to do a job, not to go in the record books, those 4-1/2 points we'll need tomorrow for the overall victory we will have to fight hard for; it's not going to be easy."</seg>

<seg id="9">I've been trying to do everything properly," said the theater worker, who was taking part in her first armored combat festival.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the field, fighters dressed head to toe in authentic chain-mail armor battled it out and while their swords may have been blunt, some left with dented helmets and one, a cut lip.</seg>

<seg id="15">"All the costumes are hand stitched.</seg>

<seg id="2">FBI agents investigating U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have contacted the second woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct, her attorney said on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer John Clune indicates that the FBI probe of Kavanaugh will look beyond separate allegations of attempted rape leveled against the conservative federal appeals court judge by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University dormitory when they were undergraduates.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.S. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI investigation after Thursday's Senate hearing, during which Ford, a California university professor, detailed her claims that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when the two were still high school teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had constrained the FBI investigation by limiting its parameters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trump denied that story, tweeting that "Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion."</seg>
<seg id="8">White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate had set the "scope and duration" of the FBI probe, which is supposed to be wrapped up in a week.</seg>

<seg id="2">Francesco Molinari fittingly took the glory as Europe regained the Ryder Cup in dominant style on Sunday, the Italian beating Phil Mickelson on the 16th to post the point needed to reach the magic tally of 14.5.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mickelson conceded the hole after firing his tee shot into the water with Molinari on the green to leave the Italian as the first European to win all five matches in a week - having not won any of his previous six.</seg>
<seg id="4">Europe were effectively already assured of victory when he teed off as the Italian, Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were all dormie and guaranteed at least half a point from their games - with Europe at that stage needing one.</seg>
<seg id="5">They had started the day 10-6 up, needing to secure four and a half of the 12 points available to win back the trophy and extend their stranglehold on home soil that dates back to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only twice before had a team come from four down going into the singles to win - the US doing so at Brookline in 1999 and Europe in 2012 in the "Miracle of Medinah," but another stunning comeback never really looked on the cards.</seg>

<seg id="2">A pair of police officers in eastern Germany used the name of a notorious neo-Nazi extremist to work undercover during an operation to protect Turkish President Erdogan who visited Berlin this week, local media reveal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Criminal police in the eastern German state of Saxony are inquiring into two members of elite counter-terrorism unit SEK, the regional interior ministry said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The men were deployed to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his much-anticipated trip to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the officers had to work undercover, protocol required that they use a codename.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their choice was Uwe Boehnhardt, a notorious member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) - a neo-Nazi extremist group that slaughtered eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek citizen, and a German police officer in the 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="7">The bizarre codename surfaced when the two signed up to access internal documents they needed for the deployment, local media report.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers in charge of the operation reacted swiftly, and the policemen were immediately recalled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Petric Kleine, the head of Saxony criminal police, was first to react to the news.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said the use of Boehnhardt's name was "hardly to be beaten in stupidity" and represented "blatant disregard of [his] victims and their relatives."</seg>
<seg id="11">Roland Woller, Saxony's interior minister, echoed the words, calling it "disgusting, horrible and absolutely unacceptable."</seg>
<seg id="12">Erdogan's Friday visit to Berlin has stirred considerable controversy in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for hosting a leader which some accuse of being increasingly authoritarian.</seg>
<seg id="14">Merkel said the visit was very important "because when there are differences a personal meeting is vital to resolve them."</seg>
<seg id="15">The NSU first came to light in 2011 when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were found inside a burnt-out motorhome in eastern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">The two are believed to have died in an apparent murder-suicide after a failed bank robbery in a town of Eisenach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beate Zschaepe, the neo-Nazi gang's third and last surviving member, was detained shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="18">In July of this year, a German court sentenced her to life in prison, finding her guilty on 10 counts of murder.</seg>
<seg id="19">She denied participating in the murders, although her lawyer said that she felt morally guilty for not trying to prevent the killings.</seg>
<seg id="20">The scandal surrounding the NSU has led to widespread criticism of German security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lawyers, activists, and relatives of the victims believe that the group had far more accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="22">It also came out that the BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, had placed numerous informants within the NSU and systematically thwarted and made impossible the investigation of murders, attempted murders, and robberies attributed to the group.</seg>

<seg id="2">Elon Musk has settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which had sued him for fraud over his tweets about taking Tesla private.</seg>
<seg id="3">Musk will have to step down as chairman, but gets to keep his CEO status.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the settlement filing, Musk has 45 days to step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, and is banned from holding the position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="5">He will also have to pay a $20 million fine.</seg>
<seg id="6">And since the whole affair started over a tweet, either careless or intentionally misleading, Musk is required to receive pre-approval for anything he says or posts about Tesla, "in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g., Twitter), the Company's website (e.g., the Company's blog), press releases, and investor calls."</seg>
<seg id="7">Another $20mn will be paid by Tesla to settle claims it had failed to vet Musk's initial tweet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The SEC complaint accused Musk of misleading investors with his August 7 tweet which said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, boosting the company's stock by more than 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Musk soon recanted, saying he would keep Tesla private and triggering investors' fury.</seg>
<seg id="10">The SEC ruled Musk's initial words "were false and misleading because they lacked any basis in fact."</seg>
<seg id="11">Musk himself claimed it was an honest mistake, writing in a blog post that he was under the impression that he had secured the money in a meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.</seg>
<seg id="12">Musk and the SEC had reportedly been close to a less punishing settlement, which would only have barred Musk from being chairman for two years and would not have required him to admit any guilt, but Musk backed out on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then on Friday, Tesla stock tanked, apparently causing him to change his mind again and accept the harsher conditions.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, like the old deal, the new one does not require Musk to admit to being guilty of misleading investors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has shown support for the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is part of the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="3">It comes amid a rift between the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Theodore II arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on Thursday, meeting high church representatives and the Orthodox faithful.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected hierarchs of the Orthodoxy, second only to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have come here to tell you: Stay with the Orthodox faith and with the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ahead of the visit to Odessa, he met with the head of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Savva, who backed the canonical Ukrainian church as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">The two also called for conflicts stemming from giving autocephality to the Ukrainian church to be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We will always be with those who seeks the Orthodox unity," Theodore II pledged.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Orthodox Church has faced a major crisis recently, following the Constantinople Patriarchy's move towards recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latter is a constituent part of the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Constantinople has decided to send its exarchs to Kiev, effectively violating the rule in which one Orthodox Church is forbidden to interfere in the internal affairs of another.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exarchs are special representatives of a patriarch, who technically have a higher position in the church hierarchy than Metropolitan Onufriy, the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to Constantinople's move, suspending the joint performance of church services and membership in all the structures led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.</seg>
<seg id="15">The decision, however, was said to be a "warning" to Constantinople against further hostile steps and does not constitute a complete break of inter-church ties.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ukraine hosts three Orthodox Churches, yet only one of them - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate - is recognized by other Churches.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most Ukrainian clerics recognize its authority, but the government has been openly courting one of the schismatic churches - the so-called Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="18">The religious movement even has its own self-proclaimed "Patriarch" Filaret, who seeks to gain the official status of an Orthodox Church, fully independent and "equal" to the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Major takeaways from Lavrov's UN speech</seg>
<seg id="2">At the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lashed out at the West's "political blackmail and brute force," saying diplomacy should not give way to diktats and unilateral sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trying to preserve their "self-proclaimed status as world leaders," some Western powers have no qualms about putting pressure on others, Foreign Minister Lavrov told the UN General Assembly on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He didn't name the countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force."</seg>
<seg id="5">The world has to pay a high price for these selfish ambitions by a tiny group of countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lavrov, who was once Russia's envoy to the UN for a decade, told the gathering that the culture of diplomacy and negotiating is being replaced by diktats and one-sided sanctions put in place without UN approval.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such restrictions that extend to dozens of countries "are either unlawful or inefficient," the minister noted, citing the US" decades-long blockade of Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="8">"But history didn't teach us anything," Lavrov said, adding that allegations "based on the notorious "highly likely" thing are sufficient for some Western counterparts to pin the blame on anyone."</seg>
<seg id="9">We do remember how often these unfounded claims were used to justify interventions and ignite wars, such the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, 2003 invasion of Iraq and 2011 intervention in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The list of Western-led invasions was obviously not exhaustive, as Lavrov referred to the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest instances.</seg>
<seg id="11">A failed attempt to topple the regime in Damascus - which was conducted by engaging extremists - could have seen the whole country collapse and give way to a "terrorist caliphate."</seg>
<seg id="12">Lavrov praised the Astana Peace Process, launched jointly by Russia, Turkey, and Iran, which he said helped prevent Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and other groups from claiming all of Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">Top priority now is to rebuild war-ridden places in the country and help refugees safely return to their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jumping back to the great powers competition, Lavrov stated that the UN was in fact created "on the lessons learnt from the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Russian foreign minister noted that 2018 marks 80 years since the "disgraceful" 1938 Munich Agreement, in which France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazi annexation of the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia in a bid to appease Hitler.</seg>
<seg id="16">Though Neville Chamberlain, then British prime minister, claimed the Munich Agreement meant "peace for our time," the war started one year later.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Munich betrayal" shows us how far "national egoism and neglect of international law" can go, Lavrov said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Colonial-era diktat and coercion should be sent into the archive or the dustbin of history."</seg>
<seg id="19">Moscow believes constructive dialogue can meet any challenges that arise in world affairs, according to Lavrov.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If you have any questions or claims to anyone, then sit down and talk, show facts, listen to your counterpart's arguments, try to balance your interests."</seg>

<seg id="3">During his UN General Assembly (UNGA) speech, the Israeli PM was adamant that Tehran has secret nuclear sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Israel keeps playing the blame game, let's see if they have their own radioactive skeletons in the closet.</seg>
<seg id="5">Using his cherished "presentations," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out with his new revelations on Thursday, showing aerial photographs of Iranian sites allegedly holding nuclear-related material.</seg>
<seg id="6">It did not take long for Tehran to fire back, saying Tel-Aviv is better to look at its own "undeclared nuclear weapons program."</seg>
<seg id="7">While Israel has never admitted - notably, not denied as well - to possess military nukes, RT's Murad Gazdiev looks at whether Tel Aviv may really be not the right country to point its fingers at others.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scottish Government: No complaints made against Alex Salmond before January</seg>
<seg id="2">The Scottish Government has said there were no recorded complaints regarding Alex Salmond before January this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two allegations of sexual harassment were made in January against the former first minister, who strongly denies the claims.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was informed of an investigation in March.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Salmond, who has since resigned from the SNP, is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Scottish Government stressed no complaints had been recorded prior to January after claims that one of those complaints was first investigated in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Scottish Government spokesman said: "The Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond.</seg>
<seg id="8">These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.</seg>
<seg id="9">No complaints were raised with the then deputy first minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are confident our processes are legally sound and we will vigorously defend our position.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, as we have said previously, for legal reasons we can make no further comment on the issues relating to Mr Salmond at this time."</seg>
<seg id="13">A spokesman for Alex Salmond said: "We have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session and we expect it to be called shortly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We will do our talking in court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government's complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."</seg>

<seg id="1">Glasgow 29-13 Dragons: Lee Jones at double for Warriors</seg>
<seg id="2">Glasgow got back to winning ways in the Guinness Pro14 with a bonus-point victory over Dragons at Scotstoun as coach Dave Rennie expressed satisfaction but felt his side could have been more clinical.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the shock defeat by Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth the previous Saturday, Rennie had called for a response from a much-changed team and, while the maximum points were duly bagged to stay top of Conference A, it was far from emphatic in what was a disjointed encounter played in swirling wind and rain.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I thought our defence was excellent tonight, we played at the right end of the field and our setpiece was great," said Rennie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We need to be a bit more clinical, there were more opportunities that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was trying conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">We created lots of opportunities which we're happy about.</seg>
<seg id="8">We want to be more clinical but having said that if we had put 40 or 50 points on the board tonight that wouldn't have been good for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">We had to work for that.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bonus-point win but we need to be better next week at home to Zebre and the week after against Saracens in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">In windy conditions, Glasgow looked to have opened the scoring early but the TMO picked up the slightest of knock-ons from Huw Jones as he looked to have gathered Niko Matawalu's inside pass and gone over in the left corner.</seg>
<seg id="12">The frustration didn't last long as in the fourth minute loosehead prop Oli Kebble burst through the middle and Adam Hastings pinged over the easy conversion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dragons reduced the lead with a penalty from Arwel Robson and the stand-off knocked over another just after the 20-minute mark to bring the Welsh to within a point.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fairly tame opening half found some kind of life around the half-hour mark as Glasgow's forwards established a sustained siege of the Dragons line before South African referee Stuart Berry penalised the Welsh side for an offside tackle in the 22 on home stand-off Hastings.</seg>
<seg id="15">Warriors opted for the scrum but surrendered possession before putting together their most fluid passage of play, left wing Matawalu not quite able to keep control of the ball after some punchy surges and a sweeping passing move out left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second try finally came two minutes from the interval when Hastings pierced the Dragons line and then popped a clever pass out to Lee Jones, whose momentum saw him crash over.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hastings saw his conversion come back off the post to make it 12-6 at half-time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Glasgow got off to the best possible start in the first minute of the second half as Alex Dunbar's delicious offload in the tackle was gleefully gobbled up by Lee Jones for his second try, Hastings adding the extras.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, any sense that the Warriors would now run away with things received a setback just four minutes later when possession was coughed up in the midfield and a fly hack was followed up by Dragons centre Adam Warren who dribbled over to score under the posts, Josh Lewis, who had come on for Robson before the break, converting.</seg>
<seg id="20">Warriors swiftly reasserted dominance and the bonus-point fourth try came in the 54th minute as Huw Jones surged over down the right, Hastings falling short with the conversion - his third miss from four attempts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Glasgow remained in comfortable ascendancy and the fifth try came with a couple of minutes left as Dunbar got on the end of a sweet offload by sub scrum-half George Horne to cruise over and Hastings" boot completed the scoring.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kebble was awarded man of the match but Rennie praised Hastings.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They obviously didn't want us to play and were flying up in the middle," said the coach.</seg>
<seg id="24">"He probably needed to hold a couple of metres of depth but he's pretty slippery and managed to find some space in behind them.</seg>
<seg id="25">He's in a good vein of form and confident."</seg>

<seg id="2">Ayr stay top of the Championship table thanks to doubles from Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore and a goal from Declan McDaid.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shankland swept Ayr into the lead from six yards after Michael Rose had headed a McDaid corner back across goal.</seg>
<seg id="4">Morton levelled with their first effort on target on 35 minutes when Charlie Telfer robbed a dithering Robbie Crawford inside his own box and sent a low shot arrowing past Ayr keeper Ross Doohan and into the far corner.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Greenock side were presented with a great opportunity to take the lead four minutes into the second half when Gary Oliver was sent tumbling by Doohan but Michael Tidser's penalty was weakly hit and easily gathered by the keeper.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ayr moved in front a second time on 74 minutes when a cross from substitute Craig McGuffie was deflected high into the air and when it fell to earth fellow replacement Craig Moore prodded home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Within a minute Moore cut the ball back for Shankland and the striker scored his 17th goal of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the visitors ran riot Moore rifled home the fourth from the edge of the box and McDaid slammed home a rebound to complete the scoring.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Delighted, relieved, happy," beamed Ray McKinnon after Falkirk finally registered their desperately-needed first league victory and points of the season.</seg>
<seg id="3">A double from 18-year-old on-loan Rangers striker Zak Rudden either side of half-time hauled the Bairns level with hosts Alloa Athletic at the foot of the Championship and lifted a weight off the shoulders of the club.</seg>

<seg id="2">When the Queen launched a project to open her enormous archive of papers from the reign of George III, it was hoped the letters, diaries and speeches would give the public an insight far beyond his reputation for madness.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, those papers are to reach a whole new audience, as the Royal Archives form an unlikely alliance with a hit West End musical.</seg>
<seg id="4">The actor who plays George III in Hamilton has been invited into the library at Windsor Castle to study key documents from the reign of the Queen's great-great-great-great- grandfather, as academics hope to inspire others to learn more about the real king.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those documents will now be made available digitally for the show's legions of fans, as researchers work to bring their "pieces of paper with old handwriting on" to a wider audience.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the Royal family have already given their public approval to the musical, with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex going to see it twice despite Prince Harry's ancestor being thoroughly sent up on stage.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lithuanian salaries amuse Estonians: one area can change everything</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the data of the salary survey conducted by the âBaltic Salary Surveyâ this year in the Baltic States, the biggest salary increase was in Estonia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lithuania and Latvia were not far behind their neighbour, says the company's press release.</seg>
<seg id="4">âHaving surveyed 850 companies and analyzed salary changes in the Baltic States, we see that monthly salary before taxes in Lithuania increased for 81.8% employees by 7.7% on average, and annual salary with bonuses increased by 10.5% this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Latvia has slightly overtaken us - there was a slightly bigger increase in annual salary, but, like in Estonia, for a smaller number of employees compared to our countryâ, says Povilas Blusius, a representative of the company that organizes salary surveys, and he adds that with such salary increase trends the general economic indicators of the country that dictate them should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="6">The biggest salary increase was in Estonia</seg>
<seg id="7">Although in Latvia and Estonia salaries increased for a smaller number of employees than in Lithuania, but the increase was bigger.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Latvia, the annual salary increased for 71% of the surveyed employees of the companies, and the increase was a little bigger than in our country - 11%.</seg>
<seg id="9">This year, in Estonia, salary was raised for 73% of employees, and increased on average by 13%.</seg>
<seg id="10">The salary increase trends are strongly influenced by employee turnover, as those who change jobs can receive much higher salary than at the previous workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in the recent years and did not get better posts, annual salary increased by 8.8%, and bonuses here were paid more often than in other Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">In neighboring Latvia, the annual increase in salary for such employees was 3.6%.</seg>
<seg id="13">Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States for the biggest increase of salaries not only for the new, but also for the long-term employees.</seg>
<seg id="14">For those, who did not change either workplace or position, the salary increased the most: monthly - 6%, annual with bonuses - even 9%.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the salary research specialist, such trends often depend on or coincide with the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, the state monetary policy, prevailing moods in the market.</seg>
<seg id="16">For example, forecasts about the coming economic downturn encourage business to act more cautiously and to invest less.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dominant and fast growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also increase general statistics and overshadow minor changes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The biggest tax burden falls on the Latvian people</seg>
<seg id="19">When comparing salary increase, it is important to take into account different tax systems in these countries.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Latvia, employees pay the largest part of the taxes depending on their salary - even 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42,4% for those who earn more.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Lithuania there is a fixed 24% rate, therefore, with higher salary increase in Latvia, employees may have the same or even less perceptible gain than in Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Estonia, a similar tax rate applies as in Lithuania - 23.6%, thus in this country we find the most favorable taxes for the labour force in the Baltic States.</seg>
<seg id="23">The most competitive salary - in IT field</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the results of the survey, in all the Baltic States, almost regardless of the position, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best paid.</seg>
<seg id="25">The opposite situation is in retail trade - market indexes in this area are among the lowest, so the employees earn less than the market average.</seg>
<seg id="26">Compared to the last year, the salary increased most for engineers, for those who are in higher positions as well as for risk management specialists.</seg>
<seg id="27">This year salaries also increased for some positions in IT field - a large part of the organizations increased monthly salaries up to 14% for information security specialists.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, salaries remained almost unchanged in retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, some companies have successfully implemented reorganizations of salary systems, therefore, their annual salaries increased about 2% due to the bonuses.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to salary specialists, there is a tendency that salary increase dictates the need for the most demanded specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.</seg>

<seg id="2">White or brown?</seg>
<seg id="3">Which sugar to choose?</seg>
<seg id="4">Surveys at the supermarkets revealed that while Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar, it is surprising that many people do not use this ingredient, that is also called white death, at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Representatives of supermarket chains do not hide that sales of brown sugar are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the representative of âMaximaâ, brown sugar is becoming increasingly popular, and people are buying more and more of it, although ordinary white sugar is still a preferable choice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Organic sugar sales are also increasing in specialized ecological stores.</seg>
<seg id="8">One of their most popular products is coconut sugar.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to nutritionist Dalia VaitkeviÄiÅ«tÄ, the main difference is the price, but both can have harmful effects on health.</seg>
<seg id="10">âBrown non-refined sugar is three times more expensive, but from the health point of view these sugars, if used in excess, are harmful to the bodyâ, said VaitkeviÄiÅ«tÄ.</seg>
<seg id="11">For those who cannot live without sugar, the nutritionist advises to reduce its amounts little by little.</seg>
<seg id="12">This will have many benefits - one can lose unwanted kilograms and improve health.</seg>
<seg id="13">If one reduces sugar amount consistently during a month, it will be easier to stop using it at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">âIt takes about a month to form every habit, so after such an experiment, letâs say, drinking some product, coffee or tea, without sugar for a month, we will see its positive effect, and I think that everyone can give it up with a little effortâ, advises nutritionists on how to give up on sugar.</seg>
<seg id="15">Doctors say that sugar is called white death for a reason - abusing sweets can cause obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, it would be worth trying to consume as little sugar as possible, because this product is also added to many foods, including bread.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on to create a "real European army" to allow the bloc to defend itself against Russia and even the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">E. Macron, who has pushed for a joint European Union military force since his arrival in power, said that Europe needs to decrease its dependency on the American military might.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has gained a significant argument after the US President Donald Trump announced that Washington will pull out of an important Cold War-era nuclear treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">âWe have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,â E.Macron told radio station âEurope 1â.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was his first radio interview since becoming the president in May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">âWhen I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its securityâ, said the French leader.</seg>
<seg id="8">The aforementioned missile crisis was triggered by a non-strategic nuclear arms race at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This crisis was a major contributor for the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987.</seg>
<seg id="10">âWe will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European armyâ, said E.Macron in an interview recorded on Monday evening in Verden, North East France, during the Presidentâs visit to the battlefields of the World War I this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to E.Macron, in a situation âwhen Russia, which is at our borders and has shown that it can be a threat..., we need Europe which defends itself better alone, without just depending on the United States.â</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of France has become a main spearhead pushing the creation of a nine-country European force that could rapidly mount a joint military operation, evacuate civilians from a war zone or provide aid after a natural disaster.</seg>
<seg id="13">Defense ministers of these nine countries are set to meet for the first time on Wednesday in Paris to start discussing details of how this force will operate.</seg>
<seg id="14">European Union is due to vastly expand its defense budget starting in 2021, allocating some 13 billion euros over seven years to research and development of new equipment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Current EU defense budget is less than 600 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Bruno Alomar, a professor at the French War School, which trains top military officers, said that E.Macronâs vision of a tight-knit European defense force was a long way off.</seg>
<seg id="17">âThe idea of creating a common strategic culture is not a bad one,â he told news agency AFP.</seg>
<seg id="18">âBut thereâs a massive gap between the European defense that Emmanuel Macron dreams about and the reality of very big disagreements between European partners.â</seg>

<seg id="2">Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, said on Tuesday that his country would need new weapons, if NATO continues to mobilize forces on the western border of Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="3">âIf NATO continues to intimidate by deploying bases in Poland or in any other way, Belarus will need more sophisticated weapons, first of all, missilesâ, state news agency BelTA quotes words of A.Lukashenko who met with a group of American analysts in Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="4">The head of the state also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">âAs you noticed, and we are not hiding, that we have lately developed our own rocket industry and produced our own high-precision missilesâ, stressed the President.</seg>
<seg id="6">A.Lukashenko said last week that Minsk and Moscow are looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to the plans to build a Polish base and name it âFort Trumpâ, after the President of the United States Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="7">âOf course this concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="8">If, for instance, in Poland theyâre saying theyâre willing to spend millions of dollars to deploy [...] some Fort Trump there, of course we are not idiots, and of course we will respond to thatâ, A.Lukashenko said at a Munich Security Conference Core Group Meeting in Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="9">âOf course, we, together with our main ally [Russia], are thinking about how we could oppose this and how we could find the proper response with minimum costsâ, he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Relationship between the West and Moscow heavily deteriorated after annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their relationship is also worsened by the role of Moscow in the Syrian conflict and an attempt by, supposedly, Russiaâs special services to poison the former double agent Sergey Skripal with a substance that paralyzes the nerves, which was carried out in Great Britain this year in March.</seg>
<seg id="12">The tension between Moscow and Washington was further aggravated after D.Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Weapons Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Russia warned that this step could ruin the global security system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The man who performed a cruel execution revealed how he killed the football player who raped his wife</seg>
<seg id="2">Brazil was shaken by brutal crime during which a fierce execution was performed on this country's football player Daniel Correa Freitas.</seg>
<seg id="3">The athlete was killed during a 18-year-old girlâs birthday party.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 24-year-old football player was found dead in Parana, in the south east of Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is reported that he was executed: his genitals were cut off, it was also reported about severe injuries in the neck.</seg>
<seg id="6">Edison Brittes Junior, 38, who killed the football player, admitted his guilt and claimed to have done so because D.C.Freitas had raped his wife, Cristiana Brittes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Brazilian, who executed the terrible murder, later during the television broadcast explained in detail what happened on the fateful night.</seg>
<seg id="8">âThe party had already gained momentum when I realized that I had not seen my wife Cristiana for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="9">I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="10">I immediately broke down the door, and saw naked Daniell in bed and my wife, who was asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was deadly angry.</seg>
<seg id="12">Together with my friends at the party, we dragged him outside and jammed him in the car.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here I had a knife, with which I stabbed the man who had raped my wife to death.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was very angry, at that moment I could not control myselfâ, said the murderer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Together with his friends, he threw the dead body of the footballer near the river, where police officers are looking for the main tool of the brutal crime.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Civil Brazilian Police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and the daughter who celebrated her birthday.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is reported that police officers investigating the incident still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the party.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, recently distributed last messages and photos of the football player on âWhatsAppâ application may help the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="19">The football player sent two photographs via âWhatsAppâ to one of his friends, in which he took a photo of himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who, as it turned out later, was the murdererâs wife Cristiana.</seg>
<seg id="20">âI can sleep here.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are many women sleeping in various rooms in the house.</seg>
<seg id="22">I will eat the birthday girlâs mother, although her father is somewhere nearbyâ, the football player wrote to his buddy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The idea of Alabama backup quarterback Jalen Hurts possibly redshirting this season came to an end Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hurts was inserted into Saturday's matchup for the top-ranked Crimson Tide against overmatched Louisiana, marking the fifth game he has appeared in this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">Per a new NCAA rule this season, a player can appear in as many as four games and still qualify for a redshirt season.</seg>
<seg id="5">A report by the Athletic earlier this month suggested Hurts was planning to take that route due to his frustration over the quarterback controversy and how it was handled by the team's coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tua Tagovailoa supplanted Hurts as the starter this season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he still plans to take advantage of Hurts' skill set.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hurts guided Alabama to the national championship game against Georgia last season, but he was replaced in the second half by Tagovailoa, who rallied the Crimson Tide to a 26-23 victory.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former SEC Offensive Player of the Year, Hurts entered this season having started the previous 28 games for Alabama, posting a 26-2 record.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant predicted he will "soon" be returning to the NFL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hall of Famer Terrell Owens said for Bryant's sake, that time can't come soon enough.</seg>
<seg id="4">Responding to a question on Twitter on when he plans to sign with a team, Bryant on Friday offered a one-word tweet: "Soon."</seg>
<seg id="5">A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bryant has been without a team since the Dallas Cowboys released him in mid-April in a salary dispute.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bryant, who reportedly rejected a contract offer from the Baltimore Ravens and has continually been linked to the Cleveland Browns, said just prior to the season that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with a team.</seg>
<seg id="7">Owens, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August and still makes noises about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant's focus should be on getting back on the field -- immediately.</seg>
<seg id="8">"He has to get on the team and prove to everyone what he feels like he is capable of doing," Owens told the website.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Because everybody, if you listen to all the commentators, they feel he's lost a step, he's not the guy he once was, that he feels like he is.</seg>
<seg id="10">At this point the game, get on a roster, no matter what the money is -- if its's a one-year deal, two-year deal, whatever the case may be -- and show everybody what you're made of, what you're capable of doing."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bryant had a team-leading 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns with Dallas in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 29-year-old has gone a career-long 23 regular-season games without a 100-yard performance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since signing a five-year, $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant has failed to record a 1,000-yard season or make more than eight touchdown receptions in a season.</seg>
<seg id="14">"From a general manager's or owner's standpoint, when they feel your skillset is declining, you're not going to warrant or garner that money you're really looking for," advised Owens,.</seg>
<seg id="15">Warning that if Bryant doesn't find his way onto a roster in the near future, "then it's not going to happen," Owens said the idea of a reunion with the struggling Cowboys should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Absolutely. I dont know if that relationship is fractured," said Owens, who had 38 touchdowns in three seasons with Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I think for Dez, if the Cowboys welcomed him back and he gets an opportunity, then that bodes well for Dez and the franchise."</seg>

<seg id="2">Last week, representatives from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) paid a visit to Kaunas in order to evaluate the possibility to establish CERN Business Incubation Centre in Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are ten business incubators throughout Europe up to date in which companies receive support for the commercialization of CERN technologies, the development of innovative products and their adaptation to the needs of society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of the organization's business incubator in the country had already been discussed.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Kaunas, CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and the Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering at KTU (Kaunas University of Technology) in Santaka Valley.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the meeting at the National Innovations and Entrepreneurship Centre (NIEC), the guests together with the representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Economy and businesses discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.</seg>
<seg id="7">The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because, if established in Lithuania, CERN Business Incubation Centre will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will make great impact on the regional community of science and business innovators.</seg>
<seg id="8">âSuch incubator could accelerate the application of CERN expertise and technologies for solving important problems, for example, new technologies and artificial intelligence could be used for diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, as well as big data processingâ, said Dr. Leonas BalaÅ¡eviÄius, KTU Vice-Rector for Research and Innovation.</seg>
<seg id="9">CERN incubators, like other new business development centers, provide assistance in business development - provide information and expert advice on customizing technology in product development and help find sources of funding.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more oriented towards science.</seg>
<seg id="11">Such centre in Lithuania could engage experts in various fields: information technologies, material engineering as well as medical specialists.</seg>
<seg id="12">CERN organization is best known for its Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the worldâs largest and most powerful particle accelerator located in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, CERN does not only investigate quantum mechanics, but also other areas - from cryogenics (impact of very cold materials to substances) to particle monitoring and radiation testing.</seg>
<seg id="14">These technologies and work of scientists have impact on society in many important fields: medicine, security and industry development.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former parliamentarian and former director of Raseiniai District Municipality Administration Remigijus AÄas is suspected of bribery.</seg>
<seg id="3">He is detained.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Special Investigation Service (SIS) reports that Å iauliai Board officials are carrying out a preliminary investigation regarding possible corruption in the Raseiniai District Municipality.</seg>
<seg id="5">âFormer director of Raseiniai District Municipality Administration R. A. (Remigijus AÄas - editorâs note) is suspected of bribery.</seg>
<seg id="6">Circumstances regarding untransparent public procurement while R. A. was a director of the municipality are being investigated - a possible exceptional advantage to one private company to conclude an agreement of public procurement with the company managed by Raseiniai District Municipality.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is suspected that for this, R.A. received a bribe of high value (more than 250 times the minimum monthly wage)â, is said in the SIS press release.</seg>
<seg id="8">BNS adds that this company is âRaseiniÅ³ autobusÅ³ parkasâ.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Monday, officials also detained Vladislovas Å imaitis, the head of âRaseiniÅ³ autobusÅ³ parkasâ, the company managed by Raseiniai Municipality, who is suspected of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was confirmed to BNS by SIS spokeswoman Renata EndruÅ¾ytÄ.</seg>
<seg id="11">The SIS report said that allegations were also made to two business representatives who directly bribed Mr. AÄas or participated in masking bribes in various financial transactions.</seg>
<seg id="12">All suspects have been detained, and their workplaces and homes have been searched.</seg>
<seg id="13">Suspended membership in SDLP</seg>
<seg id="14">Remigijus AÄas was the director of the Raseiniai District Municipality Administration for some time, but in April, after the Council did not approve his report, he lost this post.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was also the Mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Mr. AÄas is a longtime member of the Seimas, he was being elected to the Parliament since 2004 as a candidate for the party âOrder and Justiceâ.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, in 2013 his and the partyâs ways have parted, and in 2016 he did not manage to win an independent mandate in the elections to the Seimas.</seg>
<seg id="17">At present Mr. AÄas belongs to the newly established Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) that has split from the Social Democrats and is led by Gediminas Kirkilas.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shortly after this news, Kirkilas, the chairman of the SDLP, announced in the press release that Mr. AÄas temporarily suspended his membership in the party while the investigation is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="19">âThe actions of the Special Investigation Service and the allegations regarding Remigijus AÄas are an unpleasant surprise to us, but in all cases law enforcement needs to take all necessary steps to find out the truth.</seg>
<seg id="20">R. AÄas temporarily suspended membership in the party while the preliminary investigation is taking placeâ, says Kirkilas, the leader of SDLP.</seg>
<seg id="21">In 2003 Mr. AÄas was a national security advisor, the head of the advisory group of the former President Rolandas Paksas, who was subsequently removed from the office during the impeachment.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mayor A.Gricius: I did not directly control work of R.AÄas</seg>
<seg id="23">Algirdas Gricius, the Mayor of Raseiniai District, and Liudas Kavaliauskas, the current head of the municipality administration, said to BNS on Monday that they had no information what particular procurement could be related to the law enforcement investigation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mayor Gricius said he had learned of the arrest of Mr. AÄas from the media.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I cannot really say, we were very distanced by our functions, I, as a Mayor, was doing my job, he (AÄas - BNS) was working for the administration, and I cannot say for what reasons or which public procurement this case was startedâ, said the mayor to BNS on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="26">He also said that for the same reasons he is not willing to evaluate former leadership of Mr. AÄas in the municipality administration.</seg>
<seg id="27">âI am afraid to say anything, that I could evaluate his work, since I did not directly control his administration work, I was presented with public procurements, competitions, told that such public procurements, such competitions took place, then what was visible in public space, concluded contracts, I saw this already as Mayor.</seg>
<seg id="28">Therefore, I cannot tell how he managed administration when he was its directorâ, said Mr. Gricius.</seg>
<seg id="29">He said that he himself did not intervene in public procurement and did not influence them.</seg>

<seg id="2">Simonas Gentvilas, vice-chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, said that because of the poorly functioning Product, Packaging and Waste Record Keeping Information System (PPWIS), at the end of the year Lithuanian manufacturers and importers may have to pay almost 90 million euros in fines.</seg>
<seg id="3">âAs the end of the year approaches, and the PPWIS system does not start functioning normally, the system crisis in the packaging industry sector is becoming a more realistic scenario.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is unofficially stated that only 1% of certificates that certify packaging waste management were issued of the intended recycling tasksâ, said Mr. Gentvilas in the press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 7 November, the member of the Seimas initiates an extraordinary meeting of the Environmental Protection Committee, with intention to discuss the situation, to find out why this program is not functioning, why the module of the program is not being actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="6">âWithout the necessary legislative or regulatory initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at the risk of having to pay huge environmental pollution taxes by the end of this yearâ, says Mr. Gentvilas.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the drawbacks and inaction of the PPWIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the âMetrailâ crisis.</seg>
<seg id="8">Concern regarding tasks</seg>
<seg id="9">Some experts warn that some companies may not be able to implement packaging waste recycling tasks set out by the state for 2018.</seg>
<seg id="10">After seeing the results of packaging recycling rates of the first half-year released by the organizations, the specialists argue that there are grounds for concern that some organizations may not be able to handle the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, some of the companies might no longer be able to benefit from the pollution tax exemption and would have to pay pollution tax for a certain amount of their yearly packaging released to the market.</seg>
<seg id="12">VÅ½ wrote that two out of three current producer organizations reject such concerns, while one of them does not provide any comments.</seg>
<seg id="13">KÄstutis Pocius, the CEO of the largest organization Public Institution âÅ½aliasis taÅ¡kasâ, said that at least formally the completion of tasks depends on solving the problems of the Product, Packaging and Waste Record Keeping Information System (PPWIS).</seg>
<seg id="14">âÅ½aliasis taÅ¡kasâ plans that this year it will be possible to complete all types of packaging management tasks, except for glass.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although âÅ½aliasis taÅ¡kasâ will not be able to complete a glass task this year, the organization promises to compensate members for the resulting losses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons</seg>
<seg id="2">While the government is planning to distribute food coupons to the less wealthy people and thus promote family or farmers trade, experts question the benefits of such an innovation.</seg>
<seg id="3">They agree that the new system will create additional bureaucratic burden.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marius Dubnikovas, the head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are outdated and will not solve the problem, and the Government should focus on increasing peopleâs income.</seg>
<seg id="5">âThe system looks rather strange and seems to be taken from older textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="6">If we want to help the public purchase something or have more purchasing power, we have to use all our capabilities to increase peopleâs income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy at one store or anotherâ, said Mr. Dubnikovas to BNS.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, by offering food coupons the Government would indulge lower income people.</seg>
<seg id="8">âObviously, the target is people with lower income, as if a voucher is put on a tray and it is written on it, here, we, this Government, gave you a voucher, so be kind to us.</seg>
<seg id="9">It sounds like some pre-election promises, where they want to put their signature to them very clearlyâ, said the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to him, the food coupon system will require additional investment, and it will increase the administrative burden as it will be necessary to supervise who and how issues them, what is their protection against counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nerijus MaÄiulis, the chief economist of âSwedbankâ said that it would not be possible to achieve both goals - supporting people with low income and small businesses - with one instrument.</seg>
<seg id="12">âIf this is the support to small businesses, vouchers help to compensate for price differences and residents can buy more expensive goods in smaller stores, then the price difference is compensated by the state from the budget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then this is a support for business, but not for the residentsâ, said Mr. MaÄiulis to BNS.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his opinion, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially change the competitive position of small stores, and, on the contrary, it would create additional bureaucratic burden and could complicate the entry of new market participants.</seg>
<seg id="15">âIt looks like itâs a rather bureaucratic instrument with a lot of administrative costs and itâs also quite uncomfortable for the residents, they should not shop at some bigger store with larger assortment closer to home, but look for several specialized stores with smaller assortmentâ, the economist said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to him, coupons are used in other countries when there is a limited amount of goods or services and they need to be given to everyone alike, or to some kind of a social group.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then, residents receive coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Mr. MaÄiulis they are also used in the labor market by providing temporary tax relief to enterprises, employing the long-term unemployed, or, for example, former prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Such practice, according to Mr. MaÄiulis, was successfully applied in Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the new food coupon system that is considered by the Government would help the poorest people, increase competition, encourage the business of small traders or farmers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Skirmantas Malinauskas, advisor of the Prime Minister, told BNS on Monday that the idea is mostly oriented towards farmers and family businesses, while purchasers with coupons could receive a 20-30% discount.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to him, the number of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not misuse them.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to save 10-15 euros per month.</seg>
<seg id="24">In his opinion, although the state budget does not provide funds for the program yet, it could be financed from this source, also possibly from the European Union funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">âNot everything that is currently foreseen or not foreseen in the budget will be final, it will change in the Seimas, as it happens, funds from one line can be transferred to another, and from the ministries, objects of financing can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is always a matter of priority, what kind of decision it would be - whether it is by refusing something, finding another additional source of income and so onâ, said Mr. Malinauskas to BNS on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="27">So far, it is being considered to what extent and when it will be possible to apply the innovation.</seg>
