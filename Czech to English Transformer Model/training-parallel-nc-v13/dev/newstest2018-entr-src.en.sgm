<seg id="1">Breaking news: Our Cosmic Visitor Huge Asteroid 2014 JO25</seg>
<seg id="2">In our Solar System there are perhaps more than billion huge, stray meteors that would cause serious consequences should they collide.</seg>
<seg id="3">Left over from the sun’s formation and having either closed or open orbits, these objects could, at times, cross Earth’s path.</seg>
<seg id="4">With a diameter of 650 meters, asteroid 2014 JO25 is such a visitor, and today at 14:24 will pass by Earth, at its closest point 1.75 million kilometers away.</seg>
<seg id="5">As time passes, we have started to hear such types of reports more and more.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most important cause of this are developments in observational techniques and tools.</seg>
<seg id="7">Consequently, we are able to identify small asteroids which could not previously be identified.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, last January a bus-sized asteroid passed by within half the distance between the Earth and the Moon (~250,000 km).</seg>
<seg id="9">And more importantly, the asteroid could be identified only a couple days before it passed by.</seg>
<seg id="10">That is to say, we could have more cosmic buses coming at us.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just imagine: What would you do if you learnt that a 20 meter diameter asteroid would fall in the middle of your neighborhood?</seg>
<seg id="12">Actually, an asteroid of that size would not wipe out your neighborhood, but it’d probably blast out all of the buildings’ windows.</seg>
<seg id="13">That would be due to the asteroid’s shock waves as it exploded in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, the asteroid that landed in Russia in 2013 was of that size and was enough to blast out buildings’ windows in a couple of cities.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, if there is was an asteroid of a 100-meter diameter targeting your neighborhood, I would advise to get up to 50 km away.</seg>
<seg id="16">Specific criteria, such as an asteroid’s size and collision angle, are the factors that would determine the depth of its crater and the damage that its impact would cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Let’s have a look at a couple of scenarios from the European Space Agency’s simulation.</seg>
<seg id="18">If an asteroid having a diameter of 100 meters collided with Earth at an angle of 45 degrees and at a speed of 60 km/s, it would form a crater 250 meters deep and 1200 meters in diameter.</seg>
<seg id="19">The collision would be the equivalent to an earthquake at six on the Richter scale and, even if you were 10 km away from the impact point, you would have third-degree burns on your body.</seg>
<seg id="20">And, 50 km away there would be bits of broken window glass.</seg>
<seg id="21">If a 1-km diameter asteroid landed, the situation would be much worse.</seg>
<seg id="22">If such an asteroid collided the with the Earth with the same angle and speed, it would form a crater 600 meters deep and 12 km in diameter.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is an entire neighborhood turning into a crater and disappearing all at once.</seg>
<seg id="24">The heat created by such a collision would cause third-degree burns on your body even if you were 100 km away from the collision point.</seg>
<seg id="25">The impact would be equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude of 8 on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">The damage caused by an asteroid depends not only on the asteroid’s chemical compound, but also on the rock formations at the point of impact.</seg>
<seg id="27">The above values are for a scenario of a hard, rock-like asteroid falling onto an area of sedimentary rock.</seg>
<seg id="28">If an asteroid mostly composed of iron landed on a surface of cold lava, the crater size would be three-times bigger and consequently, the disaster would be much greater.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sixty-six million years ago something worse happened to the dinosaurs in the disaster resulting from the impact of an asteroid 10 km in diameter.</seg>
<seg id="30">That asteroid’s led to the extermination of 75% of all sea and land creatures.</seg>
<seg id="31">If an asteroid of the size that would have destroyed the dinosaurs was on a collision course with the Earth, the safest option would be to leave the planet.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tons of objects from space are falling to earth.</seg>
<seg id="33">Most of these are burnt to ash in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some meteors, popularly known as shooting stars, are big enough to glow in atmosphere as they burn.</seg>
<seg id="35">Let’s end our article with some other, relaxing news.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to studies, no asteroid large enough to cause serious destruction is expected to collide with the Earth in the next 300–400 years.</seg>
<seg id="37">As creatures with an average lifetime of 70 years, I’m sure you are somewhat relieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flash claim for Medel: 10 million Euro!</seg>
<seg id="2">Planning to reinforce their defense, Beşiktaş has in its sights Gary Medel who, most likely, is to part ways with Inter...</seg>
<seg id="3">Going on vacation after playing in the Confederations Cup in a Chilean uniform, and recently start again with Inter, the thirty year old footballer is awaiting offers.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of Italy’s prestigious newspapers, Gazzetta dello Sport, claimed that Beşiktaş had made an offer of 10 million Euro to Inter for Medel, who can play both as defender and as a forward.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was reported that Beşiktaş made an offer to both sides and that the Chilean football player was considering living in Istanbul with his family.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, in opposition to Gazetta’s claim, it looks difficult for Beşiktaş which is under FFP limitations to pay 10 million Euro to Medel.</seg>
<seg id="7">If initially Beşiktaş can take Medel on loan as in Caner Erkin’s transfer, or should there be a serious discount in his transfer fee, Beşiktaş is likely to include the star player in to its roster.</seg>

<seg id="1">Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Referendum rebuke by Barzani!</seg>
<seg id="2">Barzani gave a speech at a ceremony in Duhok city commemorating the third anniversary of the DAESH terror group’s attack on Yazidis in the Sinjar District of Mousul City.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his speech, touching upon the issue of the independence referendum that the KRG wanted to hold on September 25the, he said "I regretfully report that we have no hope at all that Iraq would every become a proper country."</seg>
<seg id="4">With Iraq we have tried all options, but we remain totally desperate and hopeless.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this situation, and there is no guarantee that we will ever secure our rights and be protected.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, we have to show the world that we want to determine our fate by way of a referendum in order to ensure our co-existence and security.</seg>
<seg id="7">We have to stress this as well: The referendum is not an end in itself, but rather a means to reach to a larger goal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reiterating that the Iraq central government had made several promises to the Kurds after the fall of the Baath Regime in 2003, Barzani said that not much later, after the disaster in Sinjar and after fighting against DAESH, they decided to hold a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="9">Stating that KRG wanted its people to determine their fate in a peaceful and democratic way in order to protect itself and to develop, Barzani added "It has been proven with documents that a state such as Iraq cannot protect us, nor do we want it to protect us."</seg>
<seg id="10">He argued "It does not want us to progress".</seg>
<seg id="11">Reacting to the fact that the Iraqi central government gave no weapons at all for them to fight against the DAESH terrorist group, but rather that all of the weapons were supplied to Hashd Al-Shaabi, which was established quickly following a fatwa, Barzani added</seg>
<seg id="12">Peshmerga were not considered as part of Iraq’s defense system.</seg>
<seg id="13">The central government has not provided to Peshmerga what it provided to Hashd Al-Shaabi.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the constitution, Peshmerga is accepted as part of Iraq’s defense system.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, while Hashd Al-Shaabi has no existence in the constitution, by violating the law all means were made available to them.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are not saying that we are against Hashd Al-Shaabi.</seg>
<seg id="17">Peshmerga and Hashd Al-Shaabi have fought on the same front, but then why is Hashd Al-Shaabi being legalized, yet Peshmerga’s existence and fight against terrorism is being covered up.</seg>
<seg id="18">These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="19">On 03 August 2014, DAESH terrorist organization attacked the Yazidis living in the Sinjar District of Mousul Province, killing a number of people, among whom were women and children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="2">Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="3">The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."</seg>
<seg id="13">There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="20">The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="21">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">The torch is not to light the way to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="25">Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB</seg>
<seg id="2">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team</seg>
<seg id="3">UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="4">A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="9">British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the guy on the corner street, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="12">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Eilidh is slightly modest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="20">She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It just shows how far we've come.</seg>
<seg id="27">And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for my captain's speech?</seg>
<seg id="29">Yeah, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="30">I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="31">So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="38">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="43">Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="45">Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="46">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a great showcase for this course."</seg>
<seg id="9">Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's a wonderful place to play golf in.</seg>
<seg id="14">The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."</seg>
<seg id="16">Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm happy with how it's going so far."</seg>
<seg id="22">Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.</seg>
<seg id="23">Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.</seg>

<seg id="1">I have found the answer</seg>
<seg id="2">Think of a "armchair".... With a budget of 6,867,000,000 Turkish Lira, larger than eleven ministries: Economy; Development; Energy and Natural Resources; Science Industry and Technology; Environment and City Planning; Health; Culture; Tourism!</seg>
<seg id="3">Its personnel count is 117,378.</seg>
<seg id="4">Turkey’s largest ‘propaganda base’!</seg>
<seg id="5">Yes, I am talking about the Religious Affairs Directorate!</seg>
<seg id="6">Yes, it is the President of Religious Affairs Directorate Görmez that I will be talking about!</seg>
<seg id="7">For days... I have been looking for an answer to the question in my head...</seg>
<seg id="8">I am curious about the real reason for the unseating of Mehmet Görmez...</seg>
<seg id="9">I have read every articles about his unseating.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nothing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I cannot find the answer I am searching for to the question.</seg>
<seg id="12">Just at the beginning of this year...</seg>
<seg id="13">Mehmet Görmez prepared the Religious Affairs Directorate’s 2017-2021 Strategic Plan.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Erdoğan gave him a Mercedes S 600 model car worth one million Turkish Lira for his service.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, he had no problem with Erdoğan.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, what happened?</seg>
<seg id="17">You can very well say "He has been in the office for seven years, isn’t that enough".</seg>
<seg id="18">First the President of the DİB, M. Rıfat Börekçi, served for seventeen years.</seg>
<seg id="19">As you all know, Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz occupied the seat for eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="20">So... The duration of a president’s term is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="21">I am getting back to my question: Why did Mehmet Görmez leave his position?</seg>
<seg id="22">It just fell on us...</seg>
<seg id="23">His closeness to Shia</seg>
<seg id="24">A source close to the government said: - "According to scholars, Mehmet Görmez did not look out for orthodox followers of the sunnah!"</seg>
<seg id="25">The decoding of this sentence is this: He did not look out for the Sunnis!</seg>
<seg id="26">The person who said this added immediately after: - "The traditional scholars saw him as a modernist!"</seg>
<seg id="27">So, Mehmet Görmez was perceived as a reformer.</seg>
<seg id="28">What did reformer mean?</seg>
<seg id="29">The answer of this question was hidden in one of Mehmet Görmez’s overseas trips.</seg>
<seg id="30">Date: 25 December 2015.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to participate in the Twenty-ninth Unity Conference in Tehran, aimed at rapprochement amongst the Islamic schools of thought.</seg>
<seg id="32">He met with Iran’s religious leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.</seg>
<seg id="33">He lined up to pray with Shia clergy.</seg>
<seg id="34">And in that conference he said: "Schools of thoughts are the humanly created schools, formed over time, representing different ideas and interpretations in understanding the religion of Islam".</seg>
<seg id="35">The goal of all was to set a path to reach Allah.</seg>
<seg id="36">Each of these are secondary roads, leading up to the main road, and their ultimate destination is the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unifying a school of thought with the religion, or holding membership of a school over Islam, can never be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separation based on schools of thought, alienation and conflict are the reflections of fanaticism and ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="39">In situations where school of thoughts precede the religion, the religion itself was the most damaged...</seg>
<seg id="40">I would like to reiterate this by underlining:</seg>
<seg id="41">Shia and Sunnis are one single Islamic Community, Ummah...</seg>
<seg id="42">"No one can accuse another of blasphemy because the other side does not understand Islam in the way that he does"...</seg>
<seg id="43">One year later...</seg>
<seg id="44">The Thirtieth Unity Meeting was attended by Selahattin Özgündüz, representing Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="45">So...</seg>
<seg id="46">This is not the Sunni idea, it’s Wahabism</seg>
<seg id="47">Mehmet Görmez’s trip to Iran and the speech he gave made him the target of the "traditional scholars".</seg>
<seg id="48">That was the reason why no one representing the Turkish State attended the following conference in Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="49">In any case, Mehmet Görmez received an invitation four times, but couldn’t attend.</seg>
<seg id="50">The reason was obvious; "traditional scholars" in the DİB who are anti-Shia/anti-Iran.</seg>
<seg id="51">Immediately after the Iran trip, since the beginning of 2016, they began to chip away at Mehmet Görmez’s position.</seg>
<seg id="52">The main person responsible for this was the Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş who was in charge of the DİB!</seg>
<seg id="53">Mehmet Görmez was so suffocated that Görmez demanded that the DİB be subordinated under the Presidency.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the core of it...</seg>
<seg id="55">Within the state, There are difference about Sunnism.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Traditional scholars" whose theoretical worlds were shaped in the madrasahs of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were unifying Sunni thought with Wahabism-Salafism under the shadow of the USA!</seg>
<seg id="57">These took such an anti-Iran position that they couldn’t even put up even with the Tehran trip.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cübbeli Ahmet’s words for Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: "The Diyanet has never had one more dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="59">"O My Lord, bestow upon us a president who is loyal to our homeland, to our people and loyal to the orthodox followers of the sunna"...</seg>
<seg id="60">The "Orthodox Followers of the Sunna" was used as a code for an anti-Iranian stand.</seg>
<seg id="61">What once the CIA-backed FETÖ did, nowadays new names are supporting this CIA-backed anti-Iran stand.</seg>
<seg id="62">On top of that, via FETÖ plots...</seg>
<seg id="63">A photo of a young man holding a whisky glass was served to the press as "Mehmet Görmez’s son"!</seg>
<seg id="64">What a coincidence!</seg>
<seg id="65">Who opposed Mehmet Görmez the most in the press? The Pro-USA Işıkçılar Group, with their newspaper Türkiye!</seg>
<seg id="66">The result...</seg>
<seg id="67">- Resisting bringing Sunni thought up to the Saudi Wahabi-Salafi line...</seg>
<seg id="68">- Not fueling differences between schools of thought...</seg>
<seg id="69">- A modernist... A man of religion was terminated by a group of "traditional scholars", formed with a Cold War era mentality....</seg>
<seg id="70">The USA’s cultural imperialism’s and its speeding up of the Arab-izing of Turkey (making it Wahabi-Salafi) continues.</seg>
<seg id="71">The future of the Religious Affairs Directorate will, no doubt, be one that will represent the Wahabi-Salafi school!</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>

<seg id="2">A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="2">A Ministry of Family and Social Policies programme for individuals and families fighting chronic diseases and living in poverty will initially supply 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients with social aid.</seg>
<seg id="3">Under the social aid programme, patients will be supplied with support at two-third of the minimum wage along with regular psycho-social support.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to reports, following the directives of the Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, it has been confirmed that work has begun on the details and a code of practice for the "New Social Aids Program for Families Fighting with Chronic Diseases".</seg>
<seg id="5">The social aid programme, run in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and the first of its kind worldwide in many of its features, started with the aim of supporting individuals fighting chronic diseases while also facing economic and psychological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="6">In completing the programne’s preparations, the Ministry will not only provide families with monetary support through social aid, but also provide regular psycho-social support.</seg>
<seg id="7">In this way, the programme’s aim is to not leave any poor, chronically ill individuals and their families alone without any material or moral support.</seg>
<seg id="8">Based on studies undertaken, in the new social aid programme’s first stage, regular psycho-social and monetary support will be supplied to poor citizens who are fighting against Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) disease caused by tuberculosis and the measles microbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the programme’s later phases, poor citizens fighting against other rare and risky diseases will also be included in the social aid programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to the planned provide support at a level of two-thirds of the minimum wage, further payments will be made to tuberculosis patients who are identified by the health unit as being unable to fulfill their medical self-care, who are bedridden, or whose houses or living conditions need to be improved.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to benefit from this support, the per capita monthly household income should be less than two-thirds of the minimum wage’s monthly net amount.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other than that, citizens with SSPE disease should obtain a medical board report prepared according to the procedures and principles specified in "Directives on Disability Criteria, Classification and Medical Board Reports for the Disabled."</seg>

<seg id="2">A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.</seg>
<seg id="3">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.</seg>
<seg id="13">For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.</seg>
<seg id="14">Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.</seg>

<seg id="1">EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.</seg>
<seg id="5">At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="7">Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="16">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="19">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="23">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."</seg>

<seg id="2">With exports in July reaching their highest level in six years, unemployment falling from 13% in January to 10.5% in April, and the confidence index rising to its highest in 3.5 years, Turkey’s inflation has fallen to single digits.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to data released yesterday by the Turkey Statistics Institution (TUIK), while the Consumer Price Index (TUFE) rose by 0.15% in July, the 9.79 annual inflation from January till today, inflation has fallen to single digits for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the main consumption groups, using July at the monthly basis, the largest increase was 1.75% in the restaurants and hotels group, and the largest decrease was 3.51% in garments and shoes.</seg>
<seg id="5">On an annual basis, the largest increase was in the transportation group, with 15.24%.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pointing to July inflation coming down to single digits, in line with expectations, Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu said "The decrease in the food and garment groups’ prices has had an effect on the modest course of inflation."</seg>
<seg id="7">But, in opposition to the headline, there are increases in core indicators, in comparison to the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We don’t expect any loosening in the firm stand of the Central Bank" he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Against decreases in headline inflation, we experienced an increase in core inflation indicators.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the customized consumer indexes closely watched by the Central Bank, the B index increased from 9.07% to 9.46% and the C index increased from 9.20% to 9.60% in July.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indicating that the inflation rate could end the year at 9.3%, Kapital FX Research’s Deputy Director, Enver Erkan, said "Inflation may fluctuate until December and then drop to a single digit in December."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The Central Bank could have a good opportunity in the first months of 2018" he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Deputy Prime Minister, Mehmet Simsek said Inflation will close the year in single digits.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Central Bank’s financial tightening will continue until inflation drops beneath 7%.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will finalize the reforms in the coming Food Committee.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci said Inflation’s drop to single digits makes us happy, but this should be permanent.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the fight against inflation, the volatility of food prices should be decreased and supply must be increased.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Minister of Development, Lutfi Elvan, added Maybe a bit of an upward trend will be seen in the coming months in the annual inflation rate due to fundamental effects, but from the first months of 2018 the fall in the inflation rate will be evident.</seg>
<seg id="19">We estimate that the annual inflation will decrease further.</seg>

<seg id="9">Unfortunately, violence against health workers is rampant.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yesterday (the day before yesterday) evening we had another example of the same incident with an assault on our cardiovascular surgical physician by a patient’s relative.</seg>

<seg id="9">Having one foot, one eye and one ear in the West and the other foot, eye and ear in the East, we, as Turks, from the time of the Ottomans, have lived under continuous dilemmas when it comes to perceiving realities and change.</seg>
<seg id="10">Old and new, some of us have tried to transport yesterday into today, understanding today through concepts applicable to the old conditions while presenting tomorrow as if it was yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="11">Others, when it comes to perceiving domestic and worldwide realities and changes, act as quickly as the thought centers of the developed countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has been the source of continuous conflicts and tensions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Madrasah and university, Janissary and the modern army, the encounters of belief with doubt were responsible for a dramatic-content dualism.</seg>
<seg id="14">Progressiveness and the old, It gets even worse as it was never accepted that a period’s new and progressive would age and, over time, be left behind.</seg>
<seg id="15">Later, yesterday’s progressives would start to describe the new and progressive as ‘Dangerous’, and those who wanted to interpret domestic and global realities as appropriate for an updated reality as a ‘Traitor’.</seg>
<seg id="16">The most important lesson is that, because of the delayed perception of domestic and international realities among the Ottomans who ruled the life of the intellect and the state, the empire fell apart, was ruined, and people became impoverished.</seg>
<seg id="17">The most important lesson for the Republic of our Ottoman past was that an indispensable prerequisite for survival was a faster perceiving of the world’s conjectures and changes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because this lesson was absorbed so well, following World War I we became a nation that could preserve its unity, integrity, stability during peacetime, an exemplary country of the region.</seg>
<seg id="19">A different approach Getting safe and sound through the global changes with which we are surrounded, we have to leave behind taboos and act based on reality.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it will do no good for anyone to carry on with those meaningless polarizations and vendettas of the past that caused our democracy to stumble.</seg>
<seg id="21">Besides, in today’s world, the smallest error will lead to large, dramatic crises.</seg>
<seg id="22">On this issue, the most problematic region is the one that we are in: the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turkey wind</seg>
<seg id="2">Trusting in Turkey’s future, large global companies competed "tooth and nail" in yesterday’s wind turbine tender.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the tender, run under a model developed by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources as they seek to reduce foreign dependency and to move towards domestic energy sources, a world record was broken.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aiming to reduce Turkey’s energy costs, the tender also paved the way for an investment of one billion USD and around 4,000 jobs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Starting in 2019, locally manufactured wind turbines will be integrated into the system.</seg>
<seg id="6">Opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the tender for Renewable Resource Fields (YEKA) wind turbine licenses was participated in by eight consortia including major US, Chinese, German and Dutch companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Initial financial offers were presented to those identified as having bid among the five lowest offers.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the first round of bidding, the lowest bid offer was 4.19 USD/Kilowatt-Hour.</seg>
<seg id="9">The underbidding range for the subsequent auction was set to 0.01 cents.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the start of the tender, some joint-venture groups including Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to take part in the underbidding auction.</seg>
<seg id="11">Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the underbidding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Upon withdrawl of Nordex’s group, MingYang-Ilk Insaat and Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon became the two remaining in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="13">MingYang-Ilk Insaat took eleven recesses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium took no recesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Berat Albayrak, commented: This is a record-breaking day for Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="16">The underbidding auction continued for thirty rounds.</seg>
<seg id="17">The winner of the strong contest between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint-venture group, with the lowest bid offer of 3.48 USD cents/Kilowatt-hour.</seg>
<seg id="18">While the consortium tendered a bid offer of 3.49 USD cents/Kilowatt-Hour, it then lowered its bid to 3.48 USD cents/Kilowatt-hour upon request of the tender commission, chaired by the Deputy Undersecretary, Alparslan Bayraktar.</seg>
<seg id="19">The two-hour YEKA tender resulted in a world record for Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bid offer of 3.48 USD cents per kilowatt-hour broke the previous world record as the lowest figure.</seg>
<seg id="21">The record had been held by Mexico with 3.84 USD cents per kilowatt-hour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Upon completion of the tender, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Berat Albayrak, held a press conference at which he stressed that the German company Siemens had presented an important message for the region and for the world "When we look back at 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I believe that this result will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations."</seg>
<seg id="23">Our goals are high.</seg>
<seg id="24">The results emerging today have shown how the economy and the energy market are advancing in strong, sure steps.</seg>
<seg id="25">No matter how many regional crisis occur in the world, this tender makes me feel proud that Turkey is showing that it is the most trustworthy and most investable country in the region and in the world.</seg>
<seg id="26">"For all of Turkey, 80 million are proud of what we see here, and the biggest share belongs to our President who with his 15-year rule and leadership has brought Turkey to this point.</seg>
<seg id="27">Explaining that with this open, transparent and even cut-throat competitive tender they have begun a new era, Albayrak said: "One of the most important steps is that, until yesterday, a wind energy purchase cost of 10.3 USD per USD cent, including a locally manufactured contribution, became a new historical record of 3.48 USD cent per kilowatt-hour, a world record."</seg>
<seg id="28">I feel proud on behalf of my fellow citizens and my country.</seg>
<seg id="29">Minister Albayrak said that their goal is to first commission locally manufactured panels before the end of 2018. "God willing, we will include locally manufactured wind turbines with the early 2019." he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Turbines will be built in five designated regions.</seg>
<seg id="31">The wining company will commission a total of 1000 megawatts, with a condition that at least 50 megawatts will be generated by wind power in each of these five regions.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon group will invest over one billion USD.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the commissioning of locally manufactured wind turbines, every year three billion kilowatt-hours of electric energy will be produced, and the electrical needs of 1.1 million household met through wind energy.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the wind turbine facility that will be built, there will be secured a reduction of, on average, 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.</seg>
<seg id="35">The winning firm will build a factory costing over 100 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="36">An average of 300–450 locally manufactured wind turbines generating at least 2.3 megawatts of power will be produced in that factory.</seg>
<seg id="37">The consortium will conduct R&D work for ten years in at least three fields out of five in total: wing design, generator design, material technologies, production technologies, innovative gear boxes.</seg>
<seg id="38">An annual budget of five million USD has been allocated for R&D work which will employ fifty technical staff, 80% of whom should be local engineers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The factory will be established twenty-one months after the contract is signed.</seg>
<seg id="40">The project’s licence’s duration is thirty years.</seg>
<seg id="41">Kazim Türker, Chairman of Türkerler Construction, one of the companies in the winning consortium, said that there would be around 64% local manufacturing, and 35% of the equipment would be imported. He added "Equipment financing will be undertaken by foreign resources, and we are planning to finance the remainder through local banks".</seg>
<seg id="42">Türker emphasised that this tender reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.</seg>
<seg id="43">Kalyon Holding Energy Group’s chairman, Murtaza Ata, said "This has become the tender that will reduce foreign dependency by 1,000 megawatts."</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are happy with the result".</seg>
<seg id="45">Siemens Gamesa Turkey’s Senior Manager, Hakan Yıldırım, stressed that they have been active in Turkey for 160 years. "We will try our best to reduce per-unit electricity costs".</seg>
<seg id="46">The wind turbines to be manufactured in the factory will have be at least 65% domestically manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="47">At least 65% of the 8,000 industrial parts of each wind turbine will be manufactured locally (that is, at least 5,200 parts).</seg>
<seg id="48">In each of five regions, a facility of at least 50 MW will be built, with a total of 1000 MW.</seg>
<seg id="49">There will be 3,750 jobs, and each year for 10 years, 5 million USD will be spent on R&D.</seg>
<seg id="50">In the 1,000MW Wind Turbine Facility, the proportion of locally manufacturing will be 65%, and at least 300–450 wind turbines delivering at least 2.3 MW power will be produced.</seg>
<seg id="51">An investment of over 1 billion USD will construct a 400 MW/year wind turbine manufacturing capacity. There will be an investment of over 100 million USD in this factory.</seg>
<seg id="52">The electricity generated will meet the needs of around 1.1 million households. Each year, the three billion kWh of electricity energy generated will, on average, deliver a reduction of 1.5 million tonnes in CO2 emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice</seg>
<seg id="2">A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="8">Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one has ever been charged with the murders.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."</seg>
<seg id="19">A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">But not one was ever prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="31">Brooks put it more succinctly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"</seg>
<seg id="34">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."</seg>
<seg id="39">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.</seg>
<seg id="41">He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."</seg>
<seg id="44">Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="45">The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I said n---a, get off my property!"</seg>
<seg id="47">Rascona fires back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There's a beat.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="50">Greene laughs the hardest.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's alarmed, confused.</seg>
<seg id="53">Did I go too hard?</seg>
<seg id="54">"No," Greene said through chuckles.</seg>
<seg id="55">"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"</seg>
<seg id="56">"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.</seg>
<seg id="57">"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"</seg>
<seg id="58">And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="61">This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reenactment ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.</seg>
<seg id="65">A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="66">Her voice breaks on every other word.</seg>
<seg id="67">A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="68">The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="69">One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="70">They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="71">Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.</seg>
<seg id="72">As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="73">Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.</seg>
<seg id="74">"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.</seg>
<seg id="75">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="76">The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.</seg>
<seg id="79">"It's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="80">"We know that's not what's in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="81">You did this for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="82">Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.</seg>
<seg id="83">At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.</seg>
<seg id="84">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="85">"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="86">"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."</seg>
<seg id="87">Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.</seg>
<seg id="89">"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="90">"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="91">Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Metin 2" has led to a death, again!</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the initial report of the Forensic Medical Institution, the initial findings of Hakan’s preliminary autopsy indicate that the cause death was suicide.</seg>
<seg id="3">The detailed investigation found no signs on the child’s body of any blows or physical coercion.</seg>
<seg id="4">The method of suicide was suffocation, resulting from the tightening of an elastic bandage wrapped around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="5">His family identified the gauze bandage as an elastic bandage used for injuries.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to a news article by Muslim Sariyar of the Haberturk Newspaper, after completing its detailed report into the child’s death, the report indicating that it was suicide would be passed on to the Buyukcekmece Public Prosecutor’s Office which is currently handling the case.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the Police are thoroughly investigating the child’s suicide, their investigation of the computer confiscated after the incident continues.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was reported that the Police would appeal to Hakan’s friends to testify.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defined as "sanitized" by close relatives, it was reported that the investigation could involve third parties or even a gang depending on the information acquired from Hakan’s computer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Police are considering that Hakan’s suicide could have been caused by a gang.</seg>
<seg id="11">After it was confirmed that Hakan committed suicide, eyes turned to the disturbing "Metin2".</seg>
<seg id="12">Raising eyebrows on the grounds of it’s causing addiction and violence, and last year banned by the Antalya Governorate for those under 15, "Metin2" again drew attention following the 2009 murder of "small hacker", Metin Kang, aged 13.</seg>
<seg id="13">Developed in 2005 in South Korea, a website registration and membership is required to play "Metin2".</seg>
<seg id="14">In the game, players try to bring peace and justice to a world with a dragon god.</seg>
<seg id="15">While doing this, many battles occur and the level of violence increases.</seg>
<seg id="16">The game has many battle images such as cutting and piercing with tools such as a cleaver, sword, scimitar or axe, and it also includes images of people being ripped apart and eaten by wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="17">To become stronger, players buy characters.</seg>
<seg id="18">Burying their child the day following the July 25 incident in Koknar Street of Esenyurt’s Istiklal Quarter, the family repeated its allegation that a murder had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="19">The father, Mehmet Ekinci, said "His ultimate dream was to be a medical doctor. We don’t think that he could have hurt himself or others because of a game". He added "They wrapped an elastic bandage around his neck and tied a knot on the side."</seg>
<seg id="20">That’s how my son was found.</seg>
<seg id="21">In no way do we think that our son could have hurt himself, or others, or have committed suicide because of a game that he played over internet.</seg>
<seg id="22">We were aware that he played such a game.</seg>
<seg id="23">It wasn’t a game that he was absorbed in.</seg>
<seg id="24">Let’s say he’d get a little bored and just leave the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">However his mother, Gulizar Ekinci, said "There was no one entering or leaving the building".</seg>
<seg id="26">Apparently my son entered the house at a particular hour.</seg>
<seg id="27">None of these are really consistent with each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Borsa Istanbul’s 8-month revenue reaches 50%</seg>
<seg id="2">The BIST 100 Index sustained an increasing trend that started in December 2016, and in July continued its eighth successive increasing month.</seg>
<seg id="3">By recording an 8-month successive increase for the first time since July 2007, the Index has appreciated by 45.3%.</seg>
<seg id="4">With its performance from the beginning of the year, leaving behind the world’s leading stock exchange markets such as Germany, the US, the UK and Japan, the BIST 100 Index didn’t lose its leader status in July.</seg>
<seg id="5">Closing the month of July with a 7.06% increase, the BIST 100 Index was followed by the Dow Jones of the US with 2.54%, and the FTSE 100 Index of UK on 0.81%.</seg>
<seg id="6">The DAX Index of Germany and the Nikkei Index of Japan closed the month of July with a loss.</seg>
<seg id="7">When the January-July period is looked at, it was seen that the BIST 100 Index showed a higher performance than the leading global stock exchange markets as well as than those of the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">This year, based on the 2016 year-end closure, the BIST 100 Index gained 37.6% in value, followed by the Dow Jones with a 10.76 increase, the DAX Index with a 5.55% value appreciation, the Nikkei Index with a 4.55% increase and the FTSE 100 with an increase of 3.21%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Serving as an indicator of the developing countries’ stock exchange markets, the MSCI EM Index gained 23% value.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the historical process of the BIST 100 Index is looked at, it is seen that it had shown similar performances in the past.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last one was when between December 2006 and July 2007 it had closed the period with eight successive months of appreciation. The BIST 100 Index recorded an increase of 38.3% over that period.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the BIST 100 Index closed the eight months between August 1996 and March 1997, and the nine months between May 1997 and January 1998 with successive increases.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a statement made to an AA reporter, Mekra Investment Research’s Director, Eren Can Ümüt, confirmed that the BIST 100 Index had continued its increase for eight months and that the increase had exceeded 37% since the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Describing how the MSCI Emerging Markets Index had recorded a 23% increase and that looking at only this ratio, there had been a positive divergence, Ümüt said:</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the beginning of the year, fund inflows have been continuing into developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="16">Funds, especially those looking for high returns, prefer countries yielding high interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Consequently, domestic markets are affected positively by this situation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Naturally, on a global scale, the appetite for risk is comparatively high.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, share indexes with risky asset statuses are in demand.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the S&P 500 Index in the US has been recording an increase close to 11% since the beginning of the year, and almost every other week we see new record levels being tested.</seg>
<seg id="21">Underlining that FED’s three interest rate increase forecasts at the beginning of the year had stressed the markets, but that the FED removed this uncertainty by using its verbal direction policy, Ümüt said that there was a market insensitivity to the FED’s interest increase.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ümüt commented that inflation in the US was not at the desired levels, and he expected that the FED would not be rushing for an interest rate increase, avoiding radical moves’ effects on the current pricing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Saying that the US President Donald Trump’s inability to cancel health reform, known as ‘Obamacare’, had strengthened the perception that he would not be able to fulfill his expansionary fiscal policies, he said "Although the expectations of a faster growing US economy because of Trump had positively affected the stock exchange markets for a period, the promises not being realized, the FED’s and in this context the market’s hand will be strengthened due to responses indicating faster growth and faster inflation" Ümüt added.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ümüt said that, from the perspective of the Turkish markets, 2016 was a year with several negative developments, negative diverging, and that the over selling of the BIST 100 Index was an attempt to close the gap between similar markets.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ümüt was recorded as saying that they had not seen a strong recovery on the domestically sourced newsfeed, and that the current outlook could be interpreted as more like triggering domestic markets to try to close the differences resulting from the increased risk appetite in the international arena.</seg>
<seg id="26">Discussing how technically testing new record levels at 108,600, the BIST 100 Index recorded small profit growth, Ümüt commented</seg>
<seg id="27">Especially the 109,500–110,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="28">After approaching these levels, it is normal to realize profit sales.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the short term, we think that, regarding pricing over 110,000, we should form a new narrative domestically or intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="30">At the moment, falling beneath 107,500 could trigger profit sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such case, even if we support 107,000, I think we could see some easing down to the 106,000–105,500 region.</seg>
<seg id="32">Specifically, the breaking of the support to 105,500 could bring a decrease to the104,300 level, which resulted from the increase from 100,000 to 108,600, corresponding to a Fibo level of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="33">Pointing to the fact that both the FED’s and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) decisions would be the focal point of the global market, Ümüt said that the expectations on FED were already known, but that although no interest rate increase is expected in the September FOMC, the possibility of a balance sheet reduction being enacted might trigger a strengthening of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id="34">Saying that this situation could trigger profit sales in developing countries share indexes, which are dominated by their excessive short term buying, Ümüt said "In addition to this is, more importantly, what the ECB will say."</seg>
<seg id="35">After the Monetary Policy Committee’s July meeting, the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, had said that they would be discussing the course of monetary policy in the fall, and that this narrative had secured a Euro/USD parity increase to levels over 1.1700.</seg>
<seg id="36">Therefore, statements about reducing or terminating the monthly 60 billion Euro asset buying program would mean that liquidity would also be reduced on a global scale by the ECB in the post-FED period.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Hence, some negative prices pressures could break out in countries with high current account deficits and limited access to foreign funds, like Turkey" he commented.</seg>
<seg id="38">Gedik Yatırım Investment Consultancy’s Director, Erol Gürcan, said that in the aftermath of Trump’s election in US in November 2016, there was a serious rally in the global share markets.</seg>
<seg id="39">Stating that it would be possible to say that this rally was triggered, in essence, by Trump’s initial promises of tax reductions and by developments that could increase global growth expectations, Gürcan said:</seg>
<seg id="40">In the global rally, Borsa Istanbul took its place among the leading stock exchange market.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although one of the most important reasons for this was that in recent years the BIST 100 Index had remained at a discounted level compared to similar developing countries’ markets, it is important to note that steps taken by policy makers in support of the economy and the financial markets have played significant role.</seg>
<seg id="42">Specifically, the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) activated in March has had a considerable effect on the increases that have been witnessed so far.</seg>
<seg id="43">Reporting that in the remainder of the year, positive developments were significantly reflected in the market’s pricings and that the KGF was slowly reaching its saturation point after having undertaken an important role in this increase, Gürcan commented that, although the BIST 100 Index might still remain discounted in comparison to similar countries’ markets, a search for a new narrative for the remainder of the year could become prominent.</seg>
<seg id="44">Gürcan said that developments such as the awaited details of the 180-day action plan, regulations in support of company profits with something like an increasing in the Credit Guarantee Fund’s limit, or a potential tax discount as discussed recently would each positively contribute.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stressing that central banks of important countries, like the FED, the ECB and the Bank of England, having decided to slowly tighten their stand on their current expansionary monetary policies would again be among developing countries’ critical risk factors, Gürcan said "Having continued its modest interest rate rise, the possibility of the Fed starting a balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility of one of the developed countries’ central banks–the ECB–terminating its asset buying program in the near term, and the possibility of the BOE increasing interests rates after the Fed does the same are each primary developments to be monitored"</seg>
<seg id="46">Saying that, in regards to potential adjustment movements in the index over the upcoming period, the supported region of 104,150--104,600 corresponding to the increasing trend from the beginning of the year, and a 200-hour moving average, were both very critical, Gürcan stated that, if this support region is broken out of, the adjustment movement could continue to the levels of 101,700, to 100,000, and to 99,200 in turn.</seg>
<seg id="47">Gürcan said that if the currently increasing trend is preserved, and the resistance of the current historical summit level of 108,605 is broken, the index could rise to the a range of 110,000--112,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cost of recent natural disasters is 300 million TL</seg>
<seg id="2">TSB Chairman Can Akin Çağlar said that claim notices totaling 116,007,000 TL had been submitted to insurance companies in the aftermath of the July 18 floods, that claim notices totaling 12 million TL for 800 claims were submitted to insurance companies following the July 21 earthquake in Gokova, and that claim notices totaling 168 million TL for 22,000 claims were submitted to insurance companies after the July 27 floods and hail storm in Istanbul. He added that the cost to insurance of those last three incidents came to 300 million TL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Çağlar said "From the perspective of comprehensive insurance coverage, the per-vehicle cost of the hail damage is around 3,500 Turkish Lira for the bonnet, and about 1,000 TL for the car’s windows."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The damage to the average residential premise following the earthquake is around 6,000 TL".</seg>
<seg id="5">Stressing the sector’s efforts to compensate for the economic loss, Çağlar said that three our of every four people did not have home insurance, one out of every two businesses did not have fire insurance, and that two out of three people did not have comprehensive insurance coverage. He added that "because of climate change, the risk of natural disasters is increasing."</seg>
<seg id="6">Because of our country’s low insurance levels, the risk to our citizens and institutions of meeting the costs of serious damage is increasing day by day.</seg>
<seg id="7">The entirety of these costs should not be left to the state alone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Insurance policies are not as expensive as they are thought to be, and the insurance business is not a sector that only pays for damage. It also, at the same time, performs a risk management consultancy service.</seg>

<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="1">New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="8">First of all, the wooden dome’s lead sheets were opened, and after their renewal, the external walls were cleared of dirt and corrosion.</seg>
<seg id="9">For strengthening, drainage works were undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="10">As seen upon entering, the mosque is very richly embellished.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a piece featuring star motifs. It is also very rich from the perspective of hand carving.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has a mixed style.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There are trace of the Seljuks, Ottomans and the initial effects of a baroque style in its architecture, considering that it was built in 1885s."</seg>
<seg id="14">ABDÜLHAMİT’S LABOUR IS IN IT</seg>
<seg id="15">"The chandelier in the middle of mosque is a gift from the Second German Empire."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic second runner up is Turkey’s record holder.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was born in Cuba, but he came to consider Turkey his homeland, when he came for Fenerbahçe...</seg>
<seg id="4">He became a Turkish citizen in 2013 and donned the national uniform...</seg>
<seg id="5">First, he became European champion, and then Olympic second runner up...</seg>
<seg id="6">And now, he’s one of Turkey’s most important medal hopes in the World Athletics Championship.</seg>
<seg id="7">Competing in the 400 meters hurdles, Yasmani Capello talked to SABAH prior to the championships that will start today.</seg>
<seg id="8">When you were young they didn’t want you because they didn’t like your rankings in Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="9">You hired a coach to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then they called you up, but this time you didn’t go.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some say you chose Turkey for money.</seg>
<seg id="12">What do you say?</seg>
<seg id="13">The last thing I remember about Cuba is my departure from the national team.</seg>
<seg id="14">At that moment, let’s say that I drew a line under what I experienced so far.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then I came to Turkey upon Fenerbahçe’s invitation.</seg>
<seg id="16">My entry into the national team is because of Fenerbahçe.</seg>
<seg id="17">They offered me support.</seg>
<seg id="18">With Turkey I opened a new page.</seg>
<seg id="19">In my youth I had several injuries, but I was able to put my signature to important successes because of the opportunities offered to me by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the World Athletics Championship I was impatient to do the best and to win a different title.</seg>
<seg id="21">You recently cried in a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="22">Can you tell us why?</seg>
<seg id="23">Whenever I am asked a question about Turkey’s looking out for me, I remember my childhood, my sacking from the Cuban National Team when I was 23.</seg>
<seg id="24">And, of course, how people in Turkey approach me.</seg>
<seg id="25">I felt similar feelings when the National Anthem was played after I won the gold medal in the European Championships in Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="26">I could not hold back my tears.</seg>
<seg id="27">I thank Turkey very much for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.</seg>

<seg id="31">You are with someone at the moment and you went to Cuba together.</seg>
<seg id="32">Would you like to share your experiences?</seg>
<seg id="33">The most important positive side of being with a Turk is calmness...</seg>
<seg id="34">Peace, when I compared to Cuban women...</seg>
<seg id="35">Turkish girls are protective of their relationships.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your girlfriend is at the same time your assistant coach.</seg>
<seg id="37">You are together the whole day. Does she intervene in your diet, for example?</seg>
<seg id="38">She eats more sweets than I do.</seg>
<seg id="39">(Both laugh) Actually, I do not have a very strict diet, but she intervenes from time to time into what I eat.</seg>
<seg id="40">My coach Massim Matrone frequently makes harsh warnings about my diet, but I know that this is for my own good.</seg>
<seg id="41">How are you with Turkish cuisine? Does your girlfriend cook for you?</seg>
<seg id="42">Turkish women cook well, but my girlfriend cooks better.</seg>
<seg id="43">(Laughs) Beans and rice are my first choice.</seg>
<seg id="44">I JUST LAUGHED AT HİM</seg>
<seg id="45">My coach in Cuba did not believe me.</seg>
<seg id="46">They took other young people in my place.</seg>
<seg id="47">We met in Cuba, after I won medals for Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="48">Looking at me in the face, he showed me to the young athletes and said "Look at him, I trained him".</seg>
<seg id="49">I just laughed at him.</seg>
<seg id="50">MY GLASSES ARE MY LIMITS</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone is curious about the glasses you put on for your races...</seg>
<seg id="52">I only use them for concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">TYDTA Chairman Ermut: Foreign direct investment will exceed last year’s.</seg>
<seg id="2">TYDTA Chairman, Arda Ermut, has indicated that 55% of all investment last year came after July.</seg>
<seg id="3">Relaying that there had been no decrease in investment following the July 15 FETÖ coup attempt and that, on the contrary, there had been an increase, Ermut said "Perhaps, it would have been more, but it was inhibited."</seg>
<seg id="4">If these conditions hadn’t arisen and some of the regional problems had not developed, we could have seen a greater increase with a multiplier effect.</seg>
<seg id="5">So we are more hopeful for the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="6">God Willing, it will be a much brighter year for direct investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the first five months, we have already grown 11% compared to the first five months of last year.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are hoping for more" he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Adding that "we can’t say that we are not worried about both global and regional developments", Ermut stressed that they were trying to diversify their investors.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reiterating that, normally, until 2010, 75% of direct investment came from Europe, Ermut continued</seg>
<seg id="12">This figure has fallen to 66%.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, Asia’s share went up from 2% to 7–8%.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russia’s share increased.</seg>
<seg id="15">While we were working to achieve this, some issues came up among the Gulf nations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Turkey has relations with all of them; Saudi Arabia and Qatar especially are two important actors.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the problems between those two countries are worrying us and naturally this causes investors to postpone their decisions somewhat more.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is not only about investments in Turkey, but because of this we could be experiencing some delays.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ermut recollected that in the last weeks some developments had taken place in Germany but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had displayed a clear reaction to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">When we talked with these countries’ investors, with whom the harshest political crisis is happening, President Erdoğan’s reaction was "Look, problems between governments are definitely not between the publics."</seg>
<seg id="21">Secondly, these people have come and invested in my country.</seg>
<seg id="22">For us, they are no different than Turkish companies.</seg>
<seg id="23">On the contrary, upon even the tiniest of their problems, they will come to us and we will resolve it.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We definitely won’t let them suffer" said Ermut, adding that they continued to support all investors with confidence.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ermut said "We can also give an assurance of this for the upcoming period."</seg>
<seg id="26">You will see that no German company, or any other investors coming from countries with which we have some political issues, will experience any difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the contrary, God Willing, we will try our best to increase investments coming from these countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">We think that investments coming from such places will increase.</seg>
<seg id="29">Certainly, political developments could sometimes affect the perception of an investment environment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"But, at this point, we will do the our part, try our best for our investors, and the perception of our investment environment will not be affected" he said, evaluating the situation.</seg>
<seg id="31">TYDTA Chairman Ermut explained that after the One Road One Belt strategy, China had more interest in Turkey, but that they expect the largest investment to come from the Gulf countries, if the problems in the Gulf are resolved.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In the relations with Germany, there isn’t one single investor saying ‘We had experienced some problems and are running away’." said Ermut, adding that there had been potential, entering and other companies that they had been monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ermut said "At the moment, around 10% of the projects in our portfolio belong to German companies."</seg>
<seg id="34">That is to say, almost 10% of the companies that we are in contact with around the world are composed of German companies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some of these already invest in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="36">If someone is going to increase their investment, or if they have an issue, then for us that project is still open.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Therefore, in fact, German companies still compose a significant part of our daily workflow" he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Stressing that all state institutions should be careful during a time in which there are perception management operations being undertaken against Turkey, Ermut said that the issue was serious and that it could be affected by the tiniest communication.</seg>
<seg id="39">Commenting on the events of the past 2–3 weeks, that there was a good lesson to be learned, Ermut said</seg>
<seg id="40">Investors’ and politicians’ agendas have always been different.</seg>
<seg id="41">We have always seen it this way, that economic relationships put political relationships onto their path, in a sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">Germany is an important trade partner of ours and will remain a significant investor.</seg>
<seg id="43">That is because they already have several investments.</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany is increasing such rhetoric.</seg>
<seg id="45">I believe that once it is over, these issues will return to their path.</seg>
<seg id="46">In particular with regards to Saudi Arabia, both countries are paying special attention to not make any negative public statements.</seg>
<seg id="47">After all, an investor is investing in Turkey because he is targeting the neighboring markets.</seg>
<seg id="48">Therefore, there is a bit of a slow down in the processes, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.</seg>
<seg id="49">But our communications with investors continue.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is my personal view that at the moment investors might be holding back on decisions that they could actually make much faster.</seg>
<seg id="51">"In the negative sense of the meaning, we have no Saudi investor saying "I see some uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, hence I am exiting the market".</seg>
<seg id="52">On the contrary, we have several Saudi investors, whose processes we are currently following, who continue to live in Turkey, spend their holidays here, and are in contact with us.</seg>
<seg id="53">Bringing to mind that last year the international direct investments (UDY) in Turkey were 12.3 billion USD, Arda Ermut said "I definitely believe that we will surpass that this year.</seg>
<seg id="54">"But, how much we will surpass this by will be affected by global uncertainties".</seg>
<seg id="55">While normally hoping for a multiplier effect, this could be a little bit more limited, Ermut said that they had had an increase of 11% in the first five months and that this could be preserved, "God Willing, if there are no such negative developments, one way or another, I definitely believe that we will close this year much better than last year".</seg>
<seg id="56">Pointing out the fact that a significant proportion of the investments that were withdrawn would continue to be in the real estate sector, Ermut shared information detailing that new investments could be witnessed in logistics, health, fintech, information technology, petrochemicals, food, energy and manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="57">Underlining the new investments that they would be announcing in the coming months, he said "In the near future, we might have an announcement to make in the manufacturing field."</seg>
<seg id="58">It will not be a billion dollar one, but a big investment.</seg>
<seg id="59">"There could be investments coming from interesting countries" Ermut commented.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1">Insurance companies’ "price cap" complaints</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TSB data, since 2006, the insurance sector vehicular arm has been loosing money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Incurring a loss of 2.35 billion TL in 2015, the sector recorded a loss of only 19 million TL in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Gunes Sigorta are trading on Borsa Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking at the TSB’s meeting at which the results of the first six months of 2017 were assessed, Çağlar said that the loss in vehicle insurance totaled 7.3 billion TL over eleven years and that, with the implementation of the premium cap, they estimated the sector’s losses could rise to 2.3 billion TL and that this year the estimated loss ratio will increase to 125%.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confirming that 2015’s figures will also be met this year, and stressing the losses incurred in 2012 and 2015 would diminish other branches’ profits, Çağlar said "This means that by financing bad drivers we are increasing the price of home insurance policies for other citizens."</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the sector, 75% is of foreign origin and, in a sense, our overseas partners are financing bad drivers".</seg>
<seg id="8">Çağlar continued, saying</seg>
<seg id="9">We have no expectation of profit from our vehicular arm but, when we look at the past eleven years, we could not point to one year in which we made profit.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We accept that too, but we continue to hope that we can transfer that loss over to other insurance policies" he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stressing the dramatic price increases when losses in the vehicular branch offset the profitability in other products, Çağlar said "In 2012 there was an increase in traffic insurance of around 30% levels, it was almost double that in 2015, and we wrote off the biggest loss in our history."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Even in an environment of such price increases, the profit of our traffic arm was only 19 million TL at the end of 2016".</seg>
<seg id="13">Saying that they were expecting to move to an autonomous tariff system next year, Çağlar said "Under the autonomous tariff system, we will decrease the price for the good driver and set a higher price for the bad driver."</seg>
<seg id="14">"However, the Treasury looks at the overall situation, and the Treasury will have the last word as to when this will happen".</seg>
<seg id="15">The Treasury Undersecretary stated that the increase in the compulsory vehicular insurance tariffs from 2015 onwards have affected a large portion of society, and that they moved to apply a maximum premium (price cap) from 12 April.</seg>
<seg id="16">Under this system, maximum premiums are set on a provincial group basis by considering the vehicle’s group, the level and density of traffic, and the accident statistics related to the compulsory traffic insurance policies to be issued.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, as of July, a compulsory traffic insurance "Risky Insured Pool" began being implemented for the levels or vehicle groups having a high damage frequency.</seg>
<seg id="18">The premiums and damage related to the vehicle insurance policies within the pool will be shared out proportionally amongst the insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="19">The premium for those insured will be set by the Treasury Undersecretariat.</seg>
<seg id="20">Çağlar said that with the premium cap implementation, the generation of premiums during the first six months of 2017 was down by 11.5% compared to the same period of the previous year, there were 8.6 million policies which was an increase of 4.9%, and taking into consideration inflation, the discount in the vehicular policies was up to 30%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Noting that this year the traffic arm would take off the profits of the industry’s other arms, Çağlar said "With these capped prices, this loss is not sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="22">How much longer could the sector bear this loss?" bear this loss?"</seg>
<seg id="23">Mentioning that the combined capital of all of the sector’s companies was 9 billion TL and, when they incurred a loss of 2.3 billion TL in the vehicular branch, the sector’s capital would be exhausted in three years, Çağlar added "Foreigners are asking ‘Why do good drivers finance bad drivers; why do my thousands of shareholders finance bad drivers in Turkey?’ ."</seg>
<seg id="24">"At this point, we are trying to explain ourselves to the Treasury" he said</seg>
<seg id="25">On the question of whether foreigners would reduce their proportional weight in the Turkish insurance sector, Çağlar said "They are not there, yet."</seg>
<seg id="26">They are expecting to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands there are six insurance policies per person, on average, while only 1.3 in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Therefore, Turkey is a place where there should be growth" he. He continued:</seg>
<seg id="28">Because of this, they have not given up.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although a company is registering a reasonable profitability, that is used for the growth of the company, leaving out the company’s profit.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the TSB’s data, the sector’s premium generation was 40.5 billion TL in 2016, and in the first half of the year 23.1 billion TL was realized, an increase of 12%.</seg>
<seg id="31">Çağlar forecasted that the sector would be finishing the year with an increase of 15% in total premiums generated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="2">So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="6">By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="8">At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the core stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="13">As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="17">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="20">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).</seg>
<seg id="22">And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.</seg>
<seg id="23">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="24">At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Qadıyanis are the Forefathers of FETÖ</seg>
<seg id="2">The British Government, from fifty years of experience, saw how loyal and self-sacrificing our family was.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government’s higher ranks have always accepted that his family was sincerely loyal to the British Government and that it provided huge services.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was necessary for the British Government to be smart and careful about the sapling it itself had planted, researching everything in detail and taking careful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="5">For understanding FETÖ, the starting point is the organization of Assassins, but a necessary difference already forgotten was that FETÖ’s appearance came about during an imperialist period and that it moved in tandem with the colonialists’ motives.</seg>
<seg id="6">So, in my opinion, the "pioneering movement" that needs to be considered is the Qadıyanis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The founder of the Qadıyanis was Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadıyani, who initially celebrated the British, and defined himself as a sapling planted by the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the small town of Qadiyan, in India’s Panjab State, Gulam Ahmed claimed that Allah had ordered him on December 1, 1888 to take homage from his followers and to form a separate group.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 1891, Gulam Ahmed went further and said that, according to divine revelations and inspirations, that Jesus, Son of Mariam, had died a natural death like other prophets and that Allah had sent him, Gulam Ahmed, as messiah and mahdi, the long-expected of the Christians and the Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to this, the messiah and mahdi expected by the Muslims are the one and the same person, and that this was Mirza Gulam Ahmed Qadiyani.</seg>
<seg id="11">(Encyclopedia of Islam, TDV)</seg>
<seg id="12">Falling completely under British rule in India after the timar holder revolt of 1857, Gulam Ahmed’s writing of books against the Hindus and Christians and defending the oppressed Muslims reminds us of Gülen defending Islam against atheism with his Chairmanship of the Fight Against Communism Association in Erzurum that, while thought to he established for religious reasons, later came to be known for its CIA support.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just like Gülen, the imperialists’ most favored of Gulam Ahmed’s ideas was that ‘jihad’ was a Muslim’s own fight against his ego and his self and that, if a Muslim can perform his religion freely, there was no aspect of fighting against imperialism.</seg>
<seg id="14">In fact, if you remember, Gülen took a step further and in one of his ‘sermons’ last year praised the Crusaders’ attacks, still a fresh wound in our history: "The Crusaders’ invasion of your country was not so dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because, between you and them are red lines.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once they did harass your wives and your daughters.</seg>
<seg id="17">They, Crusaders, won’t harass your sanctuary, didn’t!</seg>
<seg id="18">Apart from its resemblance to FETÖ, the spread of the Qadiyanis was generally realized through education and civil society fields, its thesis was the unification of the mahdi and the messiah in himself, the idea that his religious community would be the savior of the Islamist, and that the concept of jihad meant only a struggle with one’s own self,</seg>
<seg id="19">The "Humanity First" emergency relief organization is officially registered in 23 countries, its total number of Qadiyani centers worldwide is 1869, and it reportedly has over two million followers,</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, based on the available data, the Qadiyanis have 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printing houses in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and 16,000 mosques worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="21">If we consider that the "First Muslim Scientist’ given the Nobel Prize was Prof. Abdusselam, that Sir Zaferullah Han was President of the United Nations Court of Justice, that the "First Oscar-Winning Muslim Actor" was Mahershala Ali and that these were all Qadiyanis, then we can see more vividly the depth of the global powers’.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let’s add last week’s gathering of 30,000 Qadiyani members in UK as a show of force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Given that one of Qadiyani’s slogans is ‘love everyone, hate no one’, it is sufficient to quickly look over their history to understand that they really meant ‘love your invaders/colonizers’.</seg>
<seg id="24">In summary, it is possible to trace back the motivations of structures such as FETÖ or Tahirul Qadri to the Qadiyanis, to the point of origin, and that all of these organizations support them for spoiling societies so that they can approve imperialism and serve colonialism.</seg>

<seg id="2">Barış Yarkadaş said that 6,760 people worked for the TRT, many programs were outsourced, and absurd prices were paid.</seg>
<seg id="3">CHP’s MP said "Again, the TRT gave away the people’s tax money to AKP partisan companies in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="4">"This is a robbery" he said...</seg>
<seg id="5">The resources that the TRT had transferred to partisan production companies were revealed in official documents that had come to hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">The official response to the CHP’s Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş’s petition, lodged under the Right to Information Act, showed how the TRT’s resources are spent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yarkadaş said that 6,760 people work at the TRT as permanent staff, and that despite all of its technical facilities, programs were ordered via external production sources. In 2016, exactly 753,500,000TL was transferred to partisan companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The CHP’s MP described it, saying "This means looting".</seg>
<seg id="9">Barış Yarkadaş said "Production companies of pro-AKP journalists and businessmen are, in a sense, looting the TRT."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Millions are paid to productions and there is no information at all if they are watched or even produced" he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reiterating that the funds transferred to the companies are taxes collected from the people, Yarkadaş added "An institution with 7,000 personnel has became a cash cow for the AKP."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Which of the programs that these companies produced could these 7,000 not do, and the companies just took this money?" he reacted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Announcing that the TRT’s advertisement revenue for 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, Yarkadaş said that the advertisement revenue is a drop in the ocean when compared to the personnel’s salaries and other expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yarkadaş added "Being the mouth piece of the AKP, the TRT is unable to obtain commercials because it is not being watched."</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand-fed journalists take money from the TRT and then tout for the AKP.</seg>
<seg id="16">"And the people are shouldering the load" he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">CHP’s Yarkadaş continued "The TRT is paying 660,000,000 TL in annual salary for its personnel, but all of its work is outsourced."</seg>
<seg id="18">Snatched from people’s pockets was 753.5 trillion TL, which was then funneled to its partisans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Washinton-born Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), the daughter of Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, the former Minister of Industry and Trade, lost her life after falling from the nineteenth floor of a business center, also used as a hotel, in İstanbul’s Levent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Melis Salihoğlu, a 24 year-old Koç University student was found dead in her house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Salihoğlu was alleged to have hung herself.</seg>
<seg id="5">An investigation was launched into the two consecutive mysterious deaths, both of which are considered by the police to have been suicides.</seg>
<seg id="6">‘SHE LOOKED DEPRESSED’</seg>
<seg id="7">Having served in the Nihat Erim government of 1971 as Turkey’s first Minister of Trade and Industry, Ayhan Çilingiroğlu’s daughter, Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, who was born in Washington in 1966, checked in to the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1 at 17:00.</seg>
<seg id="8">Settling into her room on the nineteenth floor and with no one having received any news of her, Çilingiroğlu’s dead body was seen by a Kuwaiti tourist who informed the hotel’s administration. An ambulance and the police were called to the scene.</seg>
<seg id="9">The medical team confirmed that Çilingiroğlu had lost her life after having fallen from the nineteenth floor onto the hard surface.</seg>
<seg id="10">Giving testimony to the police, her mother Mediha Çilingiroğlu said that "She had looked depressed recently."</seg>
<seg id="11">On the 31 of August she came to İstanbul from Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="12">Via my other child I have a grandchild with leukemia.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She was dealing with my grandchild and was negatively affected by my grandchild’s illness" she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Çilingiroğlu’s body is sent to the Forensic Medical Institution, she is expected to be buried in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is still being investigated whether Çilingiroğlu has been pushed or whether she committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="16">THE ‘KILLED HERSELF’ ALLLEGATION</seg>
<seg id="17">The other suspicious death was in Sarıyer’s Zekeriyaköy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Studying at Koç University, a student Melis Salihoğlu (24) was found dead in her house.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to allegations, upon not receiving any news of her and unable to get hold of her on her mobile phone, the young girl’s father went over to her house near a school.</seg>
<seg id="20">The father found her daughter’s body in the house.</seg>
<seg id="21">Very much liked by her family, her relatives and friends, it is alleged that Melis ended her life by hanging herself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melis Salihoğlu’s death caused deep grief in her family and amongst her relatives.</seg>
<seg id="23">Writing on social media in memory of Melis "She was a bright sun, touching our faces." a friend wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eyşan running after that small ball, we were in good spirits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">It sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="10">A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.</seg>
<seg id="15">Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="20">They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="22">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="26">Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="30">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."</seg>
<seg id="32">On Friday, that hope appeared gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Using a custom template he exposed crypto FETÖ members</seg>
<seg id="2">İzmir’s Public Prosecutor, Berkant Karakaya, has completed his investigation into the leaking of information on improprieties in a ‘military espionage investigation’, which had been initiated based on the statements of the secret witness code-named ‘Sarmaşık’ and that identified the Turkish Naval Forces’ Command in Chief for Personnel Rear Admiral Cihat Yaycı as a FETÖ terrorist."</seg>
<seg id="3">In the investigation, it was stressed that Rear Admiral Yaycı was not a member of the terrorist organization. On the contrary, he had helped the investigation team expose crypto members of the terrorist group who had infiltrated the Turkish Naval Forces Command, and he was active in the fight against FETÖ.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was emphasized in the decision that an attempt to pacify Yaycı was made by putting him under the Turkish Naval Forces Command, as per the martial law orders issued during the coup attempt on July 15th, and that Yaycı was actively fighting FETÖ from day one.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Karakaya decision to decline the suit, he wrote "It is understood that with the help of a custom template, 64 fundamental criteria and 209 sub criteria, Yaycı was working on identifying the crypto FETÖ members within the confidential services of the Turkish Naval Forces Command."</seg>
<seg id="6">Paving the way for legal investigations, his special and persistent efforts were noticed, while the secret witness had no proof other than his unsupported statement. Contrary to the accusations, Yaycı was an active fighter against this terror group and he had made important contributions to this effort. It was not possible for the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office to properly evaluate an assessment based on guesswork.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rear Admiral Yaycı had previously stood trial accused of libel.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was later uncovered that FETÖ was behind it and the alleged crime was their plot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Expelled from the TSK for their FETÖ connections were former Air Pilot Staff Colonel, Hakan Dinç, for issuing a complaint against Yaycı for libel, Adana İncirlik 10th Tanker Base Commander, Air Pilot Air Commodore Bekir Ercan Van, for converting a memo into a complaint document,</seg>
<seg id="10">former General Staff Legal Counselor, Colonel Muharremm Köse, for permitting the investigation, General Staff Intelligence Chief Lieutenant, General Mustafa Özsoy, for being part of the investigation committee, the former Judge Lietuenant Commander Erkan Ağın, former Lieutenant Necmetting Aksoy for permitting the prosecution, the former Judge, Lieutenant Akif Us, and the former Judge, Lieutenant Junior Grade Serdar Çamiçi for judging the case, and former Staff Colonel Mustafa Çiçek for bearing witness against Yaycı.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the organization’s members, including FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opçin, had targeted Yaycı with material they had shared on social media before and after July 15.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>

<seg id="1">Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="2">Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="16">Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">Stressing that only 5% of patients with a herniated disc need to have surgery, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Oguz Karaeminogullari said "Depending on the results of the examination and the imaging, the first step is rest and medication".</seg>
<seg id="3">Underlining the fact that, especially in those groups of patient in which pains continue, invasive methods (such as epidural injections, radio frequency techniques, in-disc invasive methods) would be utilized, Oguz Karaeminogullari reiterated that "If there is no success with any of these methods, and if numbness in the legs and weakness is becoming more obvious, then surgery will become necessary".</seg>
<seg id="4">Pointing out that today’s risk minimizing ’fully closed herniated disc surgery’ offers an opportunity to reduce the worries of those patients who had had no success with invasive methods, Mr Karaeminogullari explained how a herniated disc can be fixed in 45 minutes:</seg>
<seg id="5">Although microscopic surgery ensures better results compared to open surgery, there might be some complications such as a longer recuperation period, issues with bonding with the spinal cord, repeated herniated disc condition, a sliding of the waist vertebra, or infection.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the time, microscopic surgery is defined as ‘closed surgery’, but microscopic surgery has same approach as open surgery.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fully closed herniated disc surgery, however, those risks are absent because the surrounding tissues are protected.</seg>

<seg id="2">A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.</seg>
<seg id="6">My son was my best friend."</seg>
<seg id="7">Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She ended his life to better her own.</seg>
<seg id="12">She has not accepted responsibility," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="14">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="16">A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="25">Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.</seg>
<seg id="26">The case has divided legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="1">A striking growth estimate from Mehmet Simsek</seg>
<seg id="2">In his statement, Simsek stated that inflation in Turkey should come down to single digits and that food inflation constituted a "risk area".</seg>
<seg id="3">Deputy Prime Minister forecast that the inflation would sink beneath 7% during 2018.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his speech, Simsek said</seg>
<seg id="5">The coming twelve months will be critical for reducing uncertainties.</seg>
<seg id="6">The biggest incentive is the reducing of uncertainties.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a strong government.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is no political uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="9">My hope is that the uncertainties in our immediate neighborhood will also decrease.</seg>
<seg id="10">By increasing our resistance to shocks with a couple of reforms, I believe we can fix Turkey to a growth rate of 5%.</seg>
<seg id="11">I spoke about this months ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">The worst is over.</seg>
<seg id="13">We should now slowly direct our energies not to those fields but to those reforms that will bring about comprehensive growth, increased employment...</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, the coming twelve months will be critical.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reforms are on one side, the reduction in uncertainties on the other and, as it stands, we don’t have any political uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="16">God Willing, if our luck permits, the difficulties in our immediate neighborhood will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="17">Whether we wanted it or not, many of our classical markets have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Such as Libya, Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="19">We didn’t just lose a market, we are up against an immigration wave of over 3.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">When we look over the last fifteen years, Turkey grew at a rate of 5.7% despite all of these shocks.</seg>
<seg id="21">Turkey, that’s us, we have robust foundations, and we have problems.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with a couple of reforms and quelling the questions in our investors’ minds, we can set Turkey, again, on a growth policy course of over 5%.</seg>
<seg id="23">Frankly, we have a very generous pension system.</seg>
<seg id="24">If I said that our pension companies do not strive enough, I believe that it would be reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="25">For one thing, the performance will be strong automatic enrollment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Why?</seg>
<seg id="27">Because we have taken precautions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The companies have to neither exert any efforts nor incur expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have completed some work, considered these worries and weak performances, and to which investment fields we will be allocating global assets and how.</seg>
<seg id="30">As you know, the deposit rates of return are high.</seg>
<seg id="31">To begin with, there will be a performance increase, in addition to the 25% that the state is giving.</seg>
<seg id="32">Further, the remainder goes to treasury bonds where the risk is generally low.</seg>
<seg id="33">When we look at the big picture, I think that interest in it will increase.</seg>
<seg id="34">Because they will see the performances.</seg>
<seg id="35">In other fields, there is success, not failure.</seg>
<seg id="36">We restructured BES in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">There are 6.8 million participants and an accumulation of 70 billion Turkish Lira.</seg>
<seg id="38">You have to hand it to them, the system has been successful.</seg>
<seg id="39">Under the automatic enrollment, there are 2.6 million participants and an accumulation of 775 billion Turkish Lira.</seg>
<seg id="40">We want some more push from the companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">They should place some advertisements, explain the system.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are working on the right to opt out.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we can flex it a bit...</seg>
<seg id="44">We will look into it, we are working on it.</seg>
<seg id="45">Maybe citizens will see the returns, see the accumulations and remain in the system.</seg>
<seg id="46">A total of 38% have left the system.</seg>
<seg id="47">Almost half of those who left are now on voluntary private pension schemes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Probable you would not want two private pension schemes.</seg>
<seg id="49">What would you do?</seg>
<seg id="50">You’d leave automatic enrollment.</seg>
<seg id="51">In fact, we were expecting the opt out to be around 10%.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, apparently we were very optimistic there.</seg>
<seg id="53">For one thing, the system is functional.</seg>
<seg id="54">We set a cap on the premiums.</seg>
<seg id="55">Sometimes insurance companies explain things from one side only.</seg>
<seg id="56">They increased the premiums very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="57">When we asked what was happening, they said that the judiciary’s decisions do not take into consideration the current regulations.</seg>
<seg id="58">We have issued new, clear regulations.</seg>
<seg id="59">And you do your part, we said.</seg>
<seg id="60">No, they said, we’ll wait for the judiciary’s decision.</seg>
<seg id="61">And we said that it could not happen like that.</seg>
<seg id="62">We have a difference of opinion here.</seg>
<seg id="63">And, when we moved to implement a premium cap, some companies refrained from accepting it.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have issued new regulations.</seg>
<seg id="65">We created a pool of risky insured.</seg>
<seg id="66">Let me tell you this and repeat it.</seg>
<seg id="67">I would prefer this system to operate on the basis of competition.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is to say, I do not find the price cap implementations correct: they were forced on us.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would have wanted to have a look at it in three dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="70">The system we created should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="71">Secondly, let the system operate normally, that is, pricing on that different path.</seg>
<seg id="72">In addition to that, their load is heavy. Around 30–31 Turkish Lira of each 100 TL premium paid is going to taxes and to SGK deductions.</seg>
<seg id="73">I am also working at the moment, and we will talk with our Minister of the Economy.</seg>
<seg id="74">Thirdly, technology is developing very fast.</seg>
<seg id="75">In time, traffic accidents will be vastly reduced, as a structural change.</seg>
<seg id="76">But this is compulsory traffic insurance.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Don’t dive just anywhere</seg>
<seg id="2">Chairman of the Turkish Neurosurgical Association Prof. Dr. Yusuf Sukru Caglar warned swimmers not to dive where they are unsure of the depth, or anywhere not more than two meters deep.</seg>
<seg id="3">Every year, thousands of people face the risk of paralysis because of neck fractures or spinal cord injuries due to diving into shallow waters.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neck fractures most frequently occur in the fifth or sixth vertebra.</seg>
<seg id="5">These fractures especially affect the nerves feeding the arm and leg muscles, as well as the respiratory muscles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prof. Dr. Caglar commented "The most important area in these kinds of accidents is our cervical vertebra region which is either cut through by fractured pieces or rendered dysfunctional by being squeezed."</seg>
<seg id="7">"And incorrect first aid in response to spinal injuries not only increases the damage, but also could lead to death" he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Diving into water ranks fourth in the causes of spinal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="9">The average age is 20–29, and most victims are male.</seg>
<seg id="10">Prof. Dr. Çağlar "One shouldn’t be diving into water into which they can’t see".</seg>
<seg id="11">"No matter how well one dives, there still could be a serious injury" he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Prof. Dr. Çağlar continued:</seg>
<seg id="13">Depending on the level of the vertebra at which the damage occurs, paralysis of varying degrees might occur in the arms and the legs.</seg>
<seg id="14">You may be able to swim, but the water might be deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="15">A place that looks deep to you might be shallow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Due to warning signs placed along sea shores in the USA and Australia, there has been a 70% decrease in swimmers’ diving injuries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prof. Dr. Çağlar added that "Although Turkey has twenty-eight provinces having a coastline, unfortunately there isn’t one single warning sign anywhere outside of Istanbul."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In response to such devastating accidents, each summer there has to be informative illuminated signs or information boards along sea shores and near pools as part of a social awareness project conducted by each province’s health directorate" he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">TURKISH Neurosurgical Association Spinal and Periferic Neurosurgery Group Chairman Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, suggested the following in the case of any such injury:</seg>
<seg id="20">The first thing to do, as soon as an accident happens, is to call 112.</seg>
<seg id="21">The neck must be kept stable, not be moved, and to the extent possible held in place by a hard collar.</seg>
<seg id="22">The supply of air must be ensured and the patient must be laid down on their side in order to drain out any water that has entered their lungs.</seg>
<seg id="23">The patient should not be suspended by the legs to drain the water.</seg>
<seg id="24">No attempt should be made to correct any deformity in the patient’s neck.</seg>
<seg id="25">The vertebrate of the neck may have been fractured.</seg>
<seg id="26">If the spinal cord had not yet been damaged, an improper positioning of the neck during first aid, or any moving of the patient, may cause fractured bone pieces to put pressure on the spinal cord or damage it by cutting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Provence lavender under threat from climate change</seg>
<seg id="2">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5">This affects the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."</seg>
<seg id="7">And a lot is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have fewer parts with essential oil."</seg>
<seg id="11">Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="44">The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.</seg>
<seg id="45">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="46">The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can count the scales on its sole.'</seg>

<seg id="6">Unless there is a structural problem or some genetic factor, the teeth of the youth are generally white.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because of aging, smoking, scratches in the dentin, or the drinking of caustic or dark colored drinks, the teeth tend to become darker over the years.</seg>

<seg id="1">A "Seniority" issue in the Turkish army</seg>
<seg id="2">Dear readers, during the Supreme Military Council held the day before yesterday, interesting decisions were taken, especially from the perspective of the Turkish Naval Forces.</seg>
<seg id="3">A vice-admiral, not a full admiral, was brought in to command of the Force.</seg>
<seg id="4">This practice has virtually never been seen in our army.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, how did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="6">The Force Commander, Full Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, had completed his term and would retire anyway...</seg>
<seg id="7">And he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now the order for the commandership was due for only remaining full admiral, that is Veysel Kösele.</seg>
<seg id="9">Victimized by a plot in the past and imprisoned for some time, Admiral Kösele was, according to normal seniority, supposed to become the commander.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, the government did not want him.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am trying to explain briefly, starting from the top, how the number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 commanders in the Naval Forces were not promoted.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this case, there was only one full admiral in the Naval Forces left.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was supposed to have been appointed to the vacant position. That is number two, Fleet Commander Full Admiral Veysel Kösele.</seg>
<seg id="14">What happened then?</seg>
<seg id="15">The government appointed Vice-admiral Adnan Özbal, sixth in rank, to the position.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, look at this scene!</seg>
<seg id="17">Full Admiral Veysel Kösele is there, but a commander of a lower rank is appointed in his place!</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior is subordinated to the junior one.</seg>
<seg id="19">I wonder what will happen next?</seg>
<seg id="20">A full admiral, higher in rank, cannot perform his duties under a lieutenant general, who is his junior.</seg>
<seg id="21">He won’t and can’t take orders from him.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this case, Veysel Kösele would not tolerate this painful behavior, he would resign today or tomorrow, and if not, he will be retired.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, this is the government’s painful message to him: "Good bye Veysel Admiral!"</seg>
<seg id="24">When I wrote this piece, rumors were spread about his resigning in the afternoon, but nothing was officially announced.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now, let’s look at what happened!</seg>
<seg id="26">The government for one reason or another opposed Veysel Kösele, did not want him, forced him to resign and appointed a vice-admiral, sixth in rank, to the commandership in his place, the government damaged the army’s traditional "seniority" concept.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is definitely politics in this and we cannot know what is behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="28">May be some day, if someone talks about it, we will learn!</seg>
<seg id="29">Dear readers, as I have tried to explain briefly above, the issue of seniority is of paramount importance.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not just as a rank.</seg>
<seg id="31">For example, an officer finishing tenth in rank in the Military Academy is more senior than the one finishing eleventh.</seg>
<seg id="32">One promoted to generalship from the first rank is more senior than the one promoted from the second rank.</seg>
<seg id="33">We experienced of concrete examples of this seniority issue during the Independence War.</seg>
<seg id="34">The commander of the Western Front İsmet Paşa...</seg>
<seg id="35">He had two armies under his command.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Army and the Second Army.</seg>
<seg id="37">Here we were in 1922, our armies were about to make a major assault and chase the Greek army away.</seg>
<seg id="38">At this stage, there were other valuable names to be appointed to the army’s commandership.</seg>
<seg id="39">One of them was Refet (Bele) Pasha.</seg>
<seg id="40">He was offered the army commandership, but he said "İsmet is junior to me, I cannot go under his command".</seg>
<seg id="41">Another is Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.</seg>
<seg id="42">Atatürk’s instructor from the Military Academy...</seg>
<seg id="43">Much loved and valued, called "Hocam", he was a commander who had partaken in various battles, a valuable and senior commander.</seg>
<seg id="44">In 1919, the military and civilian Turkish intellectuals were together caught by the British and banished to the island of Malta.</seg>
<seg id="45">On his return to the country, he was also unwilling to taking take the army’s commandership, uttering the same words: "The commander of the western front is junior to me, and I cannot take orders from him".</seg>
<seg id="46">But, Atatürk convinced him and Yakup Şevki Pasha assumed the commandership of one of our two armies.</seg>
<seg id="47">The third one has a very colorful name...</seg>
<seg id="48">Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.</seg>
<seg id="49">A talkative, continuously criticizing soldier.</seg>
<seg id="50">A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="51">He was also banished to Malta by the British, though he escaped from there and went to Kuşadası and then to Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="52">When he was offered the army’s commandership, the same things were also uttered by Ali İhsan Paşa: "İsmet is junior to me, and I cannot fight under his command"...</seg>
<seg id="53">But, he was convinced...</seg>
<seg id="54">But, after starting his duty, he continuously argued with the commander of Western Front, İsmet Pasha, whom he was subordinated to, creating a scene and disturbing the peace in the army...</seg>
<seg id="55">Shortly before the great offensive, he was discharged and retired, and Nurettin Pasha was brought in in his place.</seg>
<seg id="56">Later, Ali İhsan Pasha never got along with Atatürk.</seg>
<seg id="57">The seniority issue in the Turkish army is not only an issue at war, but also in peace.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, naturally, it should be.</seg>
<seg id="59">Veysel Kösele is the latest example of this.</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">We have nothing to lose but our chains."</seg>

<seg id="1">A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2">In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.</seg>
<seg id="7">By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="14">And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.</seg>
<seg id="15">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="17">That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="20">In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."</seg>
<seg id="21">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="22">By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="23">"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.</seg>
<seg id="24">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."</seg>
<seg id="25">The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.</seg>
<seg id="26">It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="28">"So never shut up."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I get goosebumps still talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="31">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."</seg>

<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="3">"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="4">The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="16">RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will have security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">We'll do the best we can with what we got.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm not going to worry too much about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We have a plan in place."</seg>

<seg id="2">Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.</seg>
<seg id="4">Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.</seg>
<seg id="8">She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.</seg>

<seg id="1">Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story</seg>
<seg id="2">In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"That's his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="10">And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.</seg>
<seg id="11">To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="13">For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="15">He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."</seg>
<seg id="17">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."</seg>
<seg id="19">Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just let it go, guys!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe the two are connected?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="28">Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."</seg>
<seg id="29">With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="31">But Scotney holds a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I was sad to leave," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"</seg>

<seg id="1">A "Maho" reaction to Meral Aksener</seg>
<seg id="2">The Nationalist Movement Party’s Secretary, General Ismet Buyukataman, gave a written statement concerning claims in social media and in the press about recent resignations from the MHP.</seg>
<seg id="3">Buyukataman suggested that some were taking out their grudges on social media and "in some of the old Maxists’ newspaper columns" and, he alleged, that "they are plotting to prevent the Nationalist movement from gathering under the roof of the MHP in the aftermath of September 12".</seg>
<seg id="4">Buyukataman continued</seg>
<seg id="5">"Those who cannot stand the historical existence of a Turkish nation and a Turkish homeland, those who have made mistakes, those with lengthy criminal records, those whose ideology is mixed up and whose mindset is confused, all of whom are rubbing their hands in some sort of expectation."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Now they come forward saying ‘A total of 410 people from amongst the MHP’s Kocaeli Golcuk District Organization’s administration and its members, and 215 people from the MHP’s Bursa Yenisehir District have resigned’.</seg>
<seg id="7">The public is confused by baseless, unfounded news items such as claims of 250 resignations, 300 resignations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lying has become gigantic and the deception has gone deeper in newspapers’ editorial columns.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are no such numbers of resignations and, besides, the number of those who have resigned in the said places can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Characterizing the resignations as "so-called", Buyuktataman said that again the public is being mislead by "so-called" polls and attempted perception management.</seg>
<seg id="11">Buyukataman said "These are propaganda aimed at creating an anti-MH perception, but their campaign shall turn against them".</seg>
<seg id="12">Commenting on how important and indispensable an actor the MHP is in Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Buyukataman said on the resignations:</seg>
<seg id="13">Old Marxists will never have enough power to diminish the high regard in which MHP is held in the Turkish people’s conscience.</seg>
<seg id="14">All of the comments made, the perception management, all of these have some dirty plot behind them.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is because politics and the media are focusing on the MHP’s base.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is of no importance to us if those who never contributed positively to our party when they were with us are now resigning.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those who could not resign because of their ego calculations, now they resign, so what?</seg>
<seg id="18">In their lives, the mass that didn’t contribute anything good to the MHP, that didn’t share in our memories, that didn’t understand our ideals, that didn’t participate in our struggle, and even if they participated stayed away, such mentality is extinct and should find another occupation for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="19">The efforts of those who cannot put up with the Nationalist Movement Party’s unity and integrity, and instead creates a cabal, who search for disagreements and factions, all these efforts are futile.</seg>
<seg id="20">And definitely it’ll all come around and land on those who have created it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Nationalist Movement is the last bastion of the Turkish nation, despite the heavy damage it has sustained.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his statement labeling as "political forgers", "political snatchers" those he alleges target the MHP, Buyukataman added that "Nationalist movement is not abandoned on its own."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Foreign forces with roots in their own countries, fed by forces from over the ocean, will never be able to reach their goals, whatever price they pay" he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Saying that "traitors on a leash will go mad and burn to ashes in the fire of factionalism", the MHP’s Buyukataman grouped all the opposition parties and terror groups together, claiming that "From the CHP to the HDP to the Perincek group, from the PKK to FETO, whoever does whatever deed, the Turkish nation’s determination to define its own destiny will never be plotted against."</seg>
<seg id="25">We have resisted the plans, the new tactics and the plots of a MHP without Turkes, and of a Turkey without the MHP. We have fought to the end against those who want a government without the MHP, a parliament without the MHP.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now we will destroy their plots, and bring their actor to ruin.</seg>
<seg id="27">Saying "The patent for nationalist idealism belongs to the MHP", hinting at Meral Aksener, Buyukataman continued: "Just like the old Turkish film Banker Bilo, how Maho took the villagers on a ride with the pretension of taking them to Germany but instead left them abandoned in the outskirts of Istanbul after many days of a perilous truck journey, it is so obvious that those who have resigned will be abandoned by the cliff side."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is their problem, and all we want from them is for them to be the new people in their new place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Columnists commented on the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match</seg>
<seg id="2">Kadıköy has embraced an excitement and glory that I haven’t been able to find for two seasons...</seg>
<seg id="3">The brave team that Aykut Kocaman gathered despite many absences was on the green to sign a deal of "stand behind us".</seg>
<seg id="4">We can criticize its play, positions or performances, but I have not watched such a game for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="5">He made it obvious in the first match, but yesterday he put epaulets on his shoulder: from now on, Fenerbahçe’s commander is Valbuena.</seg>
<seg id="6">During his transfer, his age had become a problem, but the expression "tenacious character" was there in Kocaman’s words.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thirty years ago we gave Atom Ant’s royalty to Rıza Çalımbay.</seg>
<seg id="8">If he can handle it, it would be the most appropriate comment for the French player.</seg>
<seg id="9">In every part of the field, joining the organization of every pass, always taking responsibility, and then letting them score the goal, he made a great show despite his short stature.</seg>
<seg id="10">Alper’s playing at the front, staying in the second striker’s position left Sturm Graz team "stranded" on the field for long periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fenerbahçe won the first half without taking a corner kick, continuously looking for a formula to get over such a hard barrier.</seg>
<seg id="12">They control the ball but then cannot generate any effective passes in the opponent’s penalty area.</seg>
<seg id="13">This outlook might bring about the comment a "center-forward is needed", but hesitating to pass to Ahmethan, we are up against a game that cannot get its only center-forward into position.</seg>
<seg id="14">Either the team did not trust the young player, or his performance needs to develop more.</seg>
<seg id="15">After getting to a score of 1-1, they could not then benefit from two clear opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Getting through the tour was important but, applauding the player’s fight, it would have benefited the night much more if they could have raised these fans for "goal".</seg>
<seg id="17">Possibly, on Monday, there will be 1-2 new transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, the reality is that Fenerbahçe’s biggest need is a number 12...</seg>
<seg id="19">With a playing style of trying to play forward and stealing the stadium’s heart, we are on the threshold of a sparkling and enjoyable season.</seg>
<seg id="20">Aykut Kocaman’s machine is setting its driving spring and just needs some more time.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for physical quality, there are in good shape.</seg>
<seg id="22">The game quality will get better.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can clearly see that every player on the field improved in self-confidence.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned</seg>
<seg id="2">Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yep.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sex robots are a big deal right now.</seg>
<seg id="5">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.</seg>
<seg id="8">"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also has moods during the day just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="18">She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"</seg>
<seg id="19">There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.</seg>
<seg id="20">On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.</seg>
<seg id="26">And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.</seg>
<seg id="30">The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="33">They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.</seg>
<seg id="35">They are pleasant slaves, in other words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's great feat?</seg>
<seg id="2">Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="3">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="7">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="14">I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="16">While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="17">The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.</seg>
<seg id="18">So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="25">The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.</seg>

<seg id="1">Last words: "I think I am dying, farewell mom"</seg>
<seg id="2">Among the people who died in London’s Grenfell Tower fire that so far has resulted in thirty confirmed deaths was an Italian citizen, Gloria Trevisan, and her boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Expressing her love, she said "I don’t want to die Mom, this isn’t fair. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, farewell".</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the dozens who have not been heard from after the fire is 26 year old Italian citizen, Gloria Trevisan, and her boyfriend, who together lived in the twenty-third storey of the twenty-four storey building.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Trevisan family’s lawyer, Maria Cristina Sandri, a resident of northern Italy, announced in a statement that, according to information obtained from the UK authorities, it has been confirmed that the two young people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="6">Relating how the young people’s families are undergoing a time of great sorrow, the lawyer told journalists to not insist on obtaining statements from them.</seg>
<seg id="7">I think I am dying, farewell mom</seg>
<seg id="8">The lawyer, Ms Sandri, said that Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, shortly after the fire broke out and that when her mother heard her daughter’s last word, she cried.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to this account, Gloria Trevisan talked to her mother a couple of times during the two hours after the fire broke out at 01:00 local time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Initially speaking more calmly, Trevisan had said "Mom, something bad is happening here, fire has broken out."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are stranded, we can’t go out.</seg>
<seg id="12">There’s a little smoke, but don’t worry, we’re waiting to be rescued.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We tried to go out the door, but the smoke was excessive and the lift wasn’t working" she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Becoming more worried in subsequent calls as the fire grew, Gloria Trevisan was reported to have said</seg>
<seg id="15">Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think I’m dying.</seg>
<seg id="17">I had a life to live before me; this isn’t fair.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don’t want to die, I wanted to help you out financially.</seg>
<seg id="19">I’m sorry I won’t be able to hug you.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thank you for everything you have done for me, farewell Mom.</seg>
<seg id="21">I am going to heaven and I’ll help you from there.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the Italian government’s mistake</seg>
<seg id="23">Both Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi had trained in architecture. After graduating last year, they had difficulty in finding a job, so last March they moved from the northern Veneto region to London.</seg>
<seg id="24">After only being able to find a job with a salary of 300 Euro in her own country, in London Gloria Trevisan quickly found a job with monthly salary of 1800 Sterling (about 2060 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="25">Sandri, their lawyer, said "Gloria Trevisan’s family was going through difficult times and that Gloria had gone to London to help her family."</seg>
<seg id="26">Unfortunately our youngsters are forced to leave the country in order to find job and save for their future.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The government should immediately find a solution to this problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is Italy’s drama: being unable to provide jobs for her youth.</seg>
<seg id="29">Gloria’s father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger saying "This is the fault of our government that forces our youngsters to travel overseas to find a job.</seg>
<seg id="30">While the unemployment rate in Italy is 12%, it is 40% among the youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">As this problem grows, for the past couple of years many Italian youngsters have been emigrating to other European countries, mostly to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="32">Last year alone, more than 110,000 people left Italy due to unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="33">Upon the confirm of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi’s deaths, the Italian press reported this as a tragedy of a country that cannot create job opportunities for its youth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD</seg>
<seg id="2">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="5">While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'</seg>
<seg id="13">He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.</seg>
<seg id="15">She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="16">The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="25">Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."</seg>

<seg id="1">White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands</seg>
<seg id="2">The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.</seg>
<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="1">Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="1">Punishment for preventing the Sala Call lifted</seg>
<seg id="2">The defendants, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz, walked over and tried to prevent the Imam of the Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque, Mustafa Baki, from performing the Call to Prayer and the Sala Calls. They were put on trial in the Twenty-Second Istanbul High Criminal Court for ‘knowingly and willingly helping a terrorist group without being a member’, ‘resisting so as to prevent the performance of duties’ and of ‘insult’ crimes</seg>
<seg id="3">.</seg>
<seg id="4">Considering both that the victim withdrew his complaint and the way in which the crime was committed, the defendant Gülşen received a fine of 7,000 Turkish Lira for ‘insulting a public officer because of his duties’, while Yılmaz, however, was sentenced to one year imprisonment for the crime of ‘resisting so as to prevent the performance of duties’, taking into account that the victim’s duty was of crucial importance at the crime’s specific date and time, and for the future of the public and of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="5">The court board ruled the punishment of imprisonment be converted into a fine of 6,000 Turkish Lira.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the two defendants had had their fines imposed upon them, the defendants’ lawyers made a request for appeal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The file then came to the Istanbul Regional Court of Justice of Twenty-third Penal Chamber for</seg>
<seg id="8">inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Completing their investigation, the Chamber decided to refuse the appeal application on the grounds that the law on the ‘insult’ crime was implemented appropriately, the action was correctly implemented, the action was qualified accurately, and on the grounds that it fitted the type of crime foreseen in the law. The court decided to the dismissal of case with prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the High Criminal Court, when the defendant Nait Yılmaz encountered the Imam Mustafa Baki as he was going out of the mosque after reading the Sala Call, Yılmaz said to him "What call to prayer? What sela call? You are taking people into the streets.’</seg>
<seg id="11">The President was taken.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saying ‘This is long finished’, trying to walk and attempting to hit him, this very action causing the victim, the imam, not to be able to read the Call to Prayer and the Sala and ‘resisting so as to prevent the performance of duties’ are included.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the reasoning of the local courts, mentioning that the action took place while the Imam was informing the public in front of the mosque, and after finishing his duty of Calling the Sala, the court claimed that the victim had not initiated and was not continuing any duty of any concrete event, and not knowing if this act constituted the crime of attempting to injure the victim during the execution of a public duty, and it not being shown how they concluded that it would prevent the victim’s future tasks, it was judged that the conclusion was reached with insufficient reasoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was recorded that the defendant had no prior criminal record, that no concrete damage was caused to the victim because of the alleged crimes, that the victim withdrew his complaint, while it was not discussed whether or not the spiritual loss prevented the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="15">JUDGEMENT RETRACTED, FİLE RETURNED Seeing that the defendant Nait Yılmaz’s lawyer’s appeal requests were found to be correct, it was decided to return the file to the Court of First Instance.</seg>
