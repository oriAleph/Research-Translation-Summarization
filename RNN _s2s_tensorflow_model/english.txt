I'm the new teacher	
I'm thinking of you	
I'm traveling light	
I'm used to waiting	
I'm used to winning	
I'm very sleepy now	
I'm very sleepy now	
I'm waiting in line	
I'm weighing myself	
I'm writing a novel	
I'm writing my will

I've been convicted	
I've been convicted	
I've been well paid	
I've done very well	
I've drunk too much

It's a long process	
It's almost October	
It's getting cloudy	
It's hard to say no	
It's just a placebo	
It's my only chance	
It's not big enough	
It's not my problem	
It's not on the map	
It's only a scratch	
It's pretty unusual	
It's real, isn't it	
It's stuffy in here	
It's time to get up	
It's unusually warm	
It's up to you, Tom	
It's very beautiful	
It's very confusing	
It's very expensive	
It's your own fault	
It's your own fault	
Japanese are Asians	
Jupiter is a planet	
Just don't get hurt

My right hand hurts	
My room key, please	
My sister likes Tom	
My tea is too sweet	
My wife is a doctor	
My wife is a doctor	
No bones are broken	
No more soup for me	
No one will miss me	
No reason was given	
Nobody believed Tom	
Nobody but Tom left	
Nobody came with me	
Nobody cares for me	
Nobody was watching	
Nobody welcomed Tom	
Nothing can stop me	
Ostriches can't fly	
Ostriches can't fly	
Our team didn't win	
Paper burns quickly	
Peaches taste sweet

Roll up your sleeve	
Rome is an old city	
Seeing is believing	
She boiled the eggs	
She has a long nose	
She has a white cat	
She has gone abroad

Should we wait here

Take whichever you want	
Tell me when he returns	
Thank you for your time	
Thanks for reminding me	
Thanks for the heads-up	
That can't happen again	
That can't happen again	
That chicken looks good	
That doesn't concern us	
That isn't what I wrote	
That law hasn't changed	
That's absolutely wrong	
That's considered a sin	
That's enough for today	
That's likely a mistake	
That's not so important	
That's the best we have	
That's the right answer

I've spent all the money	
I've visited Boston, too	
If Tom goes, I'll go too	
If only I had more money

In theory, it's possible	
In what way is it better	
Iron is harder than gold	
Is Tom telling the truth

It wasn't a pleasant job	
It wasn't enough for Tom	
It's OK to make mistakes	
It's a fast growing city	
It's a system that works	
It's always cold in here	
It's better than nothing	
It's for my personal use	
It's hard to talk to Tom	
It's in my jacket pocket	
It's my duty to help you	
It's my fault, not yours	
It's my fault, not yours	
It's my fault, not yours	
It's out of the question	
It's out of the question	
It's really cold outside	
It's time to get up, Tom	
It's time to take a bath	
It's too early to get up	
Italy is far from Brazil	
Japan is a small country	
Just answer the question	
Just tell me where it is	
Just wait a little while	
Let me have a look at it	
Let me make things right	
Let's change the subject	
Let's see if we can help	
Let's see what'll happen	
Let's try to be punctual	
Let's wait till he comes

My mother is always busy	
My mother never liked me	
My parrot died yesterday	
My plans haven't changed	
My roof has a hole in it	
My roof has a hole in it	
My sister irons my pants	
My situation has changed	
My washing machine broke	
My wife is a poor driver	
Next time, pay attention

No one was there but Tom	
No one was there but Tom	
No one will believe them	
No one will believe them	
Nobody knows your secret	
Nobody wanted to see Tom

Of course, you can leave	
Old people wake up early	
Our dog's name is Cookie	
Our work here isn't done	
Owls can see in the dark	
Owls can see in the dark

She handed me a postcard	
She is a wonderful woman	
She is all skin and bone	
She is an appalling cook	
She is drawing a picture	
She is everything to him	
She is not a good person	
She isn't lonely anymore	
She left the window open	
She lives in the village	
She looked up at the sky	
She looked up at the sky	
She looks at least sixty	
She prefers beer to wine	
She sang better than him	
She screamed and fainted	
She showed him the photo	
She used to be a teacher	
She wants to read a book	
She went there yesterday	
She will become a doctor	
She writes me every week

Should I call the police	
Should I call you a taxi	
Shouldn't we report this	
Shut the door behind you	
Skip the boring chapters	
Sledding is a lot of fun	
Sleep as long as you can	
So what exactly happened	
Somebody has to stop Tom	
Someone scratched my car	
Stay away from my sister	
Stop being such a weirdo	
Stop hitting your sister	
Suffering changes people	
Sugar dissolves in water	
Take care of your family	
Take your headphones off	
Tell me what I did wrong	
Tell me what I did wrong	
Tell me why this happens	
Thank you for your email	
That car has a roof rack	
That could be my teacher	
That happened in October	
That house belongs to me	
That is why he got angry	
That is why he got angry	
That isn't how you do it	
That isn't important now	
That isn't important now	
That makes perfect sense	
That might be fun to try	
That parking lot is free	
That should do the trick	
That wasn't my intention	
That won't fit in my car	
That wouldn't make sense	
That's a pathetic excuse	
That's a transitive verb	
That's an obsolete model	
That's just common sense	
That's not all I learned	
That's not all I learned	
That's not exactly right	
That's not how you do it	
That's what I mean to do	
That's what the law says	
The arrow hit the target	
The bear is eating honey	
The blade was very sharp	
The boy adjusted his cap	
The bus has already gone

Now it's only a matter of time	
Older dogs need a lot of sleep	
One learns from one's mistakes	
One of our cats is getting old	
One of those people may be Tom	
Only a miracle can save us now

I haven't yet edited this video	
I haven't yet edited this video	
I hear cicadas almost every day	
I heard a strange hissing sound	
I heard someone yelling my name	
I held the rope with both hands	
I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow	
I hope that we have a good time	
I hope that we have a good time	
I hung the calendar on the wall	
I just don't want to believe it	
I just want you out of my house	
I just want you out of my house	
I just want you out of my house	
I just wish I were more popular	
I knew Tom wasn't going to talk	
I knew Tom would likely do that	
I knew exactly what I had to do	
I knew it would be an adventure	
I knew this was a waste of time	
I know Tom is telling the truth	
I know Tom won't do that for me	
I know how hard Tom has studied	
I know that I'm a bit conceited	
I know that Tom doesn't like me	
I know that Tom never does that

I know they're hiding something	
I know you like being a teacher	
I know you like being a teacher	
I learn ten new words every day	
I like cats best of all animals	
I live on the outskirts of town	
I live on the outskirts of town	
I look on him as my best friend	
I might be able to do something	
I miss you when you aren't here	
I miss you when you're not here	
I missed the last bus yesterday	
I must have my bicycle repaired	
I need a good financial adviser	
I need a paper bag to put it in	
I need to cancel my reservation	
I only want what's best for Tom	
I play the guitar before dinner	
I praised him for his diligence	
I pretended that I was sleeping	
I pretended that I was sleeping	
I put it back where it belonged	
I really enjoy working with you	
I really enjoy working with you	
I really like this part of town	
I really should have known that	
I remember meeting him in Paris	
I remember seeing her somewhere	
I remember seeing you last year	
I remember seeing you last year	
I remember when I first saw you	
I saw a hippopotamus at the zoo	
I saw three guys standing there	
I saw you working in the garden	
I should've gone to bed earlier	
I spent all morning helping Tom	
I spent all morning helping Tom	
I still don't know where Tom is	
I still wish that you'd do that	
I swear that I didn't copy that	
I teach French at a high school	
I think I might be out of a job	
I think I won't like being here	
I think Tom deserves the reward	
I think Tom should go on a diet	
I think that I gave up too soon	
I think the snow will melt soon	
I think we should do that again	
I think you did that on purpose	
I think you did the right thing	
I think you did the right thing	
I think you'll enjoy the picnic

I want to take your temperature	
I want you to be ready for this	
I want you to be ready for this	
I want you to do that on Monday	
I want you to go there with Tom	
I want you to make the decision	
I wanted to continue doing that	
I wanted to learn from the best	
I was a janitor a few years ago	
I was a janitor a few years ago	
I was able to solve the problem	
I was going to reveal my secret	
I was just trying to be helpful	
I was surprised by Tom's candor	
I was surprised by his rudeness	
I went to the library on Monday	
I wish I could've gone with you	
I wish I had a reason not to go	
I wish it was as simple as that	
I wish they would stop fighting	
I won't be coming back with Tom	
I won't let Tom marry my sister	
I won't let you do that anymore	
I won't let you do that anymore	
I won't tell you why I did that	
I wonder if Tom is still lonely	
I wonder what Tom meant by that	
I would like to go to sleep now	
I wouldn't want to meet Tom now	
I wouldn't want to work for you	
I'd like to hear more about you	
I'd like to meet Tom if I could

I'd rather die than see you cry	
I'll ask Tom for an explanation	
I'll come down on Tom next time	
I'll give Tom the book tomorrow	
I'll miss you after you've gone	
I'll not be at home next Sunday	
I'll pick you up in ten minutes	
I'll send you a progress report	
I'll show you how to catch fish	
I'll tell you when you get back	
I'm a childhood friend of Tom's	
I'm afraid I owe you an apology	
I'm afraid it's not that simple	
I'm almost  centimeters tall	
I'm asking you for your opinion	
I'm asking you for your opinion

I'm not living with Tom anymore	
I'm not looking forward to this	
I'm not prepared to do that yet	
I'm not sure I want to see this	
I'm not sure about Tom's sanity	
I'm not telling you to go alone	
I'm paid thirty dollars an hour	
I'm paying with this debit card	
I'm perfectly happy being alone	
I'm sorry for the late response	
I'm sorry if I disappointed you	
I'm speaking to you as a friend	
I'm speaking to you as a friend	
I'm surprised you're still here	
I'm surprised you're still here	
I'm the one that chose the wine	
I'm the one who has your helmet	
I'm the one who has your helmet	
I'm thirty years older than you	
I'm used to talking to children	
I'm wearing a pair of new shoes	
I'm working as quickly as I can	
I'm writing a letter to Tom now	
I've already read that document	
I've already read today's paper	
I've already read today's paper

I've never eaten a live octopus	
I've never felt this way before	
I've never seen Tom do any work	
I've never seen Tom eating meat	
I've seen your driver's license	
I've seen your driver's license	
I've spent most of my life here	
I've told you everything I know	
I've told you everything I know

I've visited Boston a few times	
If I were you, I'd buy that one	
If Tom calls, what should I say	
If it helps, I'll write it down	
If possible, I'll come tomorrow	
If you don't tell Tom, who will	
In the morning, the air is cool	
Is French taught at your school	
Is it true you can speak French	
Is someone knocking on the door	
Isn't beige your favorite color	
It began to rain in the evening	
It didn't have to end like that	
It doesn't always work that way	
It doesn't always work that way	
It has to be taken into account	
It is a matter of life or death	
It is getting cooler and cooler	
It is getting darker and darker	
It is high time you were in bed	
It is high time you were in bed	
It is high time you were in bed

It isn't raining much this year	
It looked like Tom wasn't alone	
It looked like Tom wasn't alone	
It looks like you want to leave	
It looks like you're distracted	
It looks like you're distracted	
It was a lackluster performance	
It was already too late for Tom	
It was only a kiss on the cheek	
It was yesterday that I met her	
It'll rain again this afternoon	
It's a lot harder than it looks	
It's a lot later than you think	
It's a pity that Tom can't come	
It's a shame Tom didn't do that	
It's about time for us to leave	
It's about time you got married	
It's about time you got married

Light travels faster than sound	
Living conditions have improved	
London was bombed several times	
Look at the picture on the wall	
Mary has hair down to her waist	
Mary looks terrific for her age	
Matters are complicated already	
May I see your driver's license	
May I see your driver's license	
Maybe someday you'll understand	
Maybe you should try exercising	
My attitude towards him changed	
My children really like animals	
My dog slept in the bed with me	
My father doesn't understand me	
My favorite team lost yesterday	
My friends invited me to dinner

My parents are getting divorced	
My plan is different from yours	
My sister is crazy about tennis	
My sister isn't used to cooking	
My sister showed me a new watch	
No security system is foolproof	
No, thank you	
Nobody has the right to do that	
Nobody here takes Tom seriously	
Nobody knows where Tom has gone	
Nobody seems to want to go home	
Non-members pay  dollars more	
None of these T-shirts are mine	
None of us did well on the test	
Now it's time to say good night	
One of the dogs started barking	
Only adults may watch that film	
Only adults may watch that film	
Only some of us are from Boston	
Oranges have a lot of vitamin C	
Ottawa is the capital of Canada	
Our hotel is on the next street	
Our native language is Japanese	
Our neighbors are very friendly	
Pardon me, but that's my racket	
People can't live without water	
Perhaps we overlooked something	
Perhaps you should see a doctor	
Perhaps you should see a doctor	
Personally, I don't believe Tom

Sometimes, I sleep on the couch	
Stop the car

Ten percent is more than enough	
Ten prisoners broke out of jail	
That doesn't answer my question	
That doesn't mean we don't care	
That has nothing to do with you	
That has nothing to do with you	
That is why I am angry with him	
That isn't such a terrible idea	
That isn't the end of the story	
That letter is addressed to you	
That sounds too good to be true	
That'll depend on how Tom feels

People won't stop dying from this	
Perhaps you'd better come with me

Tell Tom to mind his own business	
Tell Tom what he's supposed to do	
Thank goodness you didn't do that	
Thank you so much for inviting me	
That doesn't make me a bad person	
That fox must have killed the hen	
That is my priority at the moment	
That would explain your dizziness	
That wouldn't happen in my family
